1,R2Z6FVGSWL0TD8,True,Wow! Acebeam really put a lot of thought into this product.,This truly is a beam of light. I wasn’t expecting it to be this good but I’m glad I was wrong. No one is gonna sneak up on you with this light. Only complaint is I wanted the hunting case version but it’s not available on Amazon. Other then that highly recommended for anyone who wants a serious tactical light.,the united states,"July 16, 2020",Warbucks02,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:37:07.335265,2020-11-12 15:37:07.484107,"ACEBEAM L16 Tactical Flashlight Cree XHP35 LED 2000 Lumens, Micro-USB Rechargeable, Long Throw Distance 1978ft, Waterproof for Security, Hunting, Military",4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TNRBN63,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i71AMMh0L._AC_SX522_.jpg
2,R1FGFR46NRKOCZ,True,The brightest flashlight you will find,"This flashlight is the best flashlight we have ever had. It is light-weight, but most of all it is bright. We bought one last year but between 3 boys that hunt it became the most coveted gift ever. So, this year it was on everyone's list...the first thing on their list I should add. It is worth the money.",the united states,"December 9, 2019",Sharon R.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:37:07.491087,2020-11-12 15:37:07.626724,"ACEBEAM L16 Tactical Flashlight Cree XHP35 LED 2000 Lumens, Micro-USB Rechargeable, Long Throw Distance 1978ft, Waterproof for Security, Hunting, Military",4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TNRBN63,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i71AMMh0L._AC_SX522_.jpg

4,R1FXSHEWKV3DD3,True,Flaw in Design,Within a month the flashlight stopped holding a charge. I looked at the charging indicator and noticed if I held the cable at an angle the charge indicator would come on. The design flaw is there is too much room around the charge port and the metal casing allowing too much movement eventually creating a short within the flashlight that stops it from charging.,the united states,"January 25, 2020",Brent,1.0,0,2020-11-12 15:37:07.776817,2020-11-12 15:37:07.915540,"ACEBEAM L16 Tactical Flashlight Cree XHP35 LED 2000 Lumens, Micro-USB Rechargeable, Long Throw Distance 1978ft, Waterproof for Security, Hunting, Military",4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TNRBN63,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i71AMMh0L._AC_SX522_.jpg
5,R2JRTHCOB89IX4,True,Worth it!,First impression. Nice box. Nice pouch. Very solid light. Looks well made. This light is bright!!! Took it hog hunting the same day I got it. It lights up 100 - 150 yds amazingly well. I’m sure it will reach much more. Will add more to the review as I continue to use it. First time I own a $100+ light and I don’t regret getting it.,the united states,"October 24, 2019",Robert,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:37:07.921290,2020-11-12 15:37:08.068874,"ACEBEAM L16 Tactical Flashlight Cree XHP35 LED 2000 Lumens, Micro-USB Rechargeable, Long Throw Distance 1978ft, Waterproof for Security, Hunting, Military",4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TNRBN63,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i71AMMh0L._AC_SX522_.jpg
