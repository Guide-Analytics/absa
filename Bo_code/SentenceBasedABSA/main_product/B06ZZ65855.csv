0,R1WXGLH96ASF1G,True,Obsessive Reseacher EDC Approved,"I am into the whole Everyday Carry thing and I like to carry everything I need everyday while keeping it minimal.

I obsessively spent countless hours researching for the smallest, best, coolest, keychain light out there. All of my research kept pointing towards the NiteCore Tube. This is a great addition to my keyring.

The slim profile allows me to add it to my keyring without compromising the entirety of my Everday Carry. It is a rechargeable (micro-USB) and has two modes of light (dim and bright). The dim option is good when you're in absolute darkness. However, the bright option is really bright! I use it outdoors and it illuminates everything in front of me.

BATTERY: This thing is absolutely great on battery. Considering that I use this flashlight quite regularly, I have only had to charge it twice, and that's just to top up the juice. It has an incredible standby battery life that after owning it for a month, that I've only proactively charged it.

If you're looking for a really bright slim, low-profile rechargeable keychain flashlight that weighs almost nothing, this is the product for you. I spent hours researching so you don't have to. I recommend this product.

Nitecore claims all warranty issues must be done through the vendor you purchased from which is total crap.

2,R1RFI31Q9Q0I0Y,True,The BEST overall keychain light I have ever owned!,"This is my 5th NiteCore Tube. I have loved owning quality flashlights over the years and have always yearned for a VERY long standby battery life with Very durable shell and bright enough for camping, walking and reading when necessary. Just over $10 Canadian this light has a poly-carbonate shell (practically indestructible and pocket with keys approved!) It has 2 default modes (low and high) as well as the ability to adjust the brightness infinitely. The most important aspect is the ability for the light to stay OFF under all circumstances. There is a lockout mode that does just that! At just 9 grams of weight - this thing is AMAZINGLY light and provides a surprisingly large amount of light output for it's size. 45 minutes on max brightness is easily achievable (without burning your hand) and even as the light ages past 2 years and 24+ hrs on low for an all-night nightlight when camping.
If you are looking for the bragging rights for the brightest light in the world - there is brighter available - however I would put this light up against lights costing 4X as much in the same size class. We have used this on Drones, Frisbees and even as a carabiner for your zipper on your jacket.

3,R3873WKLEG0MUG,True,"Avoid the knock-offs, get the real thing.","There are knock-offs and this is not it.

This is a very good light for attaching to your keychain. Multiple light levels with easy access to the dimmest (one-click) and the brightest (double-click). Battery lasts a good amount of time and easily charges with the micro-USB socket in the side.

Its well built and sturdy for its size. It doesn't flex when bending and has a proper metal tab for hooking into your keychain. I got the clear version as I like being able to see all the electronics.

4,RHE5R1JH7WWZ1,True,Inexpensive Source of Light,"I used a mini flashlight hanging on my keychain for a long time. The flashlight was barely adequate for my needs and the twist activation annoyed the piss out of me. The Nitecore tube is a great little keychain - it's about the size of a house key and weighs much less than an average flashlight. (No, I don't have a jewelry scale to measure...) This keychain light has four modes - momentary on (45 lumens), low (1 lumen), high (45 lumens), and step up.

The low mode is perfect for nighttime raids on the bathroom or for finding stuff in a dark purse. The momentary on (45 lumens) is seriously bright enough to left after images on my eyes for about 10 minutes.

I've left the flashlight on high and it only noticeably dims after 45 minutes. Pretty good for a flashlight that's always being carried.

I find that I'm using this flashlight every day. Being rechargeable means that I can flaff about with the batteries without it failing.

The only niggle I have with this product is that the usb cover feels flimsy and is hard to get out of the slot.

6,R238MEVTD7LFGN,True,Nice Keychain Flashlight,"I'm genuinely surprised as to how small and light this flashlight is. It's the size of a house key being about 2 inches in length. Being USB rechargeable is another great plus for this flashlight. Also at 45 lumens, this keychain flashlight is bright enough to light up your dark room and is enough light for close up tasks and for searching for those items in between furniture. The 1 lumen mode is perfect for preserving dark-adapted vision. I believe this is a must have flashlight for everyone as you can't go wrong with its size. It will save your phone's battery along with providing you with a brighter and more reliable light than that of your smartphone's. It also makes a great back-up light for those who are already carrying a larger 18650 EDC flashlight since it will always be on your keys when you leave home.

The Nitecore Tube does not come with the Micro USB cable to charge it, however since it is a common cable, the exclusion of it probably was done to lower costs.

Pros:
Keychain-friendly
Very Small and Lightweight
Bright for its size
USB rechargeable
Adjustable Brightness

Cons:

9,RUZOOV2BHG1MH,True,A well designed product!,"The size is right - not too large to be a nuisance on your key ring. The materials (polycarbonate) and construction are good. The button works well and the micro USB charging port is well sealed from dirt/moisture. A blue LED shows charging and goes out when complete. There several useful modes for the light and thankfully, the now seemingly mandatory SOS and strobe are not included! Press and hold for the 45 lumen mode. Press & release once for the low 1 lumen mode which is nice for looking for a keyhole or in movie theater (won't disturb anyone with a blast of light). Two presses is standard 45 lumens, press once and release and press and hold for variable output - interesting but not something I use. And the very useful press once - wait a couple of seconds and press and hold for 4 seconds - it will flash once and turn off. This locks the light from accidentally being turned on while in your pocket etc. To unlock, press and hold the button for 4 seconds - the light will turn in at 45 lumen level. Nothing worse than thinking you have a light to only find its discharged/dead!

10,R1Y6OU6UM28F95,True,"Durable, portable and extremely bright 45 Lumen option!","Very small and portable keychain light. I was surprised at how small it was, and it's a perfect little tool to have on a keychain. The 45 Lumen light option is extremely bright. From my experience, the battery life with the 45 Lumen option is about 30-45 minutes. On the regular brightness mode, the battery life is a lot longer. It also has a convenient micro-USB port for charging on the side that is protected by a cover. Other reviewers have noted that the cover is a bit hard to get open, but I have had no problems opening it so far. It is also very durable, as I have dropped it a few times and haven't noticed any scratches or scuff marks. There is no charging cable included, so please keep note of that before you buy it. For the price of this light, you can't go wrong.

What's good about this product?
☑ Small and portable.
☑ Durable.
☑ Affordable.
☑ Extremely bright when on the 45-Lumen option.
☑ Very large beam of brightness.
☑ Good and consistent battery life.
☑ Rechargeable with microUSB.
☑ 3 different lighting modes (normal brightness, 45 Lumen and one that starts dim and goes bright repeatedly.)

11,RDHCO5LDEPUXK,True,"Great EDC flashlight, better than button cell lights smaller than AAA aluminium keychain flashlights","I was using a small button cell flashlight which is very compact but was a pain because of cost and availability of button cells, and run time of the light. I am usually around USB cables and charging devices that can charge this without issue 95% of the time. It has a very long run time on low and 45 lumens seemed bright enough for my everyday needs. When I got it I charged it up via my laptop and micro USB cable, it took about 20 minutes. Low setting is about as bright as a tealight, with enough light in a dark room to see what is directly around me, high is quite bright and good enough for most everyday tasks like walking in the dark or looking under a piece of furniture. I was so impressed with the size and light output I bought two more right away. The only thing that would make it better would be if it had a flashing mode so that I could use it at night as a visibility aid when crossing streets etc., but I figure I can just turn it on and swing it around to catch drivers attention. For most people this will be perfect for their keychain or purse and costs less than most of the good quality aluminum lights.

Now, I have only had this a few weeks and used it a few times, I was walking out of the woods one day not long after getting it, up the sidewalk after a hike with my pack on, and was blindsided by a car not paying attn and have a lot of injuries, cannot walk or do much else right now. But before the accident, out of the box, I ran a burn test on this light --- so it likely never had a full charge 100% after shipping and sitting in a warehouse and cold truck etc. This thing, is AWESOME so far!!! Rechargeable and burns forever?? Yep.

It burned way way longer than the specs says it should - I was impressed with that of course and the features on this thing, and the ease of use w the programming and one-button. At this point, I could not be more pleased and it has really turned me onto NiteCore as a result. I cannot believe how much I love this little light weight monster and tell everyone about it!

152,R12EVJK54UPUFY,True,Great keychain light,"At its maximum setting, it's noticeably than the usual button-cell keychain light. The low setting is too dim for any help unless you're in nearly complete darkness. USB charging is a big plus. For the curious, the flashlight is 5.5 cm long, which is right around the length of a generic key.

Pros:
- pretty bright at maximum
- adjustable brightness
- rechargeable

Cons:
- no charging cable included
- the little (rather bright) LED on the inside that turns on while charging is blue-UV, meaning it's harmful for your retina. It's annoying if you charge it by laptop, but you can just put it somewhere you can't see it. Would much rather have seen a red LED for charging.

153,R3M3OLJZVAKN2Z,True,A good mini key chain led flash light.,"Good key chain L.E.D. flash light. NiteCore products up to North American standards. This is an update on this product many months down the road. I've since purchased 8-10 of these quality lights. I use these daily, about 4-5 times mininum. I have one on every keychain I own.
I own all the colors except ""pink."" (There is a possibility I puchased a pink one for my spouse) My first one, and my go to one that I've been field testing, is clear in the casing.

Not once has it failed me except for using it on ""high"" lumen output, and after about 40-50 minutes it was starting to dim. Then I switched to another one, and while working on a furnace, did the same thing.
Just recharged the Li-ion battery and carried on. Watch the pricing, it is totally all over the place for the exact same item.

I first discovered NiteCore with their battery chargers. Usually words that ryme with ""kina"" means low quality, junk. NiteCore helps to dispel that when it comes to chargers and this L.E.D. keychain light. On low lumen output it keeps on going. I have yet to have it let me down or dim on low.

I work shifts and are up at all times, and use it as not to disturb ""others"" as I move about. The low kicks out enough lumen (candle power) as not to bump into things while moving around the house, but isn't brite enough to disturb my ""others."" But when you want the extra juice, your choice, bump it up to high, or anywhere in between.

4 months of use of this little thing, and it gave out.

181,RH8WZ5C63N2TG,True,Flimsy charging port cover,"This is a review I am disappointed to write as I had high hopes for the product. Sadly the charging port cover broke off. It is clearly very flimsy, hardly fit for purpose. Disappointing as USB charging is a USP feature for peeps who are not keen on button cell replacement.

Its particularly disappointing because the UI and the lighting specification is excellent, particularly the one click to 1 Lumen which is perfectly adequate to illuminate a key-hole or door. There is always a concern (expressed in other reviews) that a single click to On might result in inadvertent activation in the pocket. To counter that there is a lockout function, from On press for 3 seconds. That works - EXCEPT - the 3 second press to unlock results in the 45 Lumen output. A stupid (or lazy) designer oversight.

So its back to this  Nite Ize Radiant Squeeze Light LED Key Chain Light - Black, N/A  This product's USP is that illumination is momentary so inadvertent full discharge is unlikely.

Vorweg, ich besitze eine Menge Produkte von Nitecore und bin von der Qualität des Herstellers überzeugt. Angefangen bei unterschiedlichen Chargern, über Akkus bis hin zu jeder Taschenlampe der Tiny Monster 26 Reihe.
Die Tube ist für den Schlüsselbund super. Handlich, eine unkomplizierte Bedienung und in orange hilft sie sogar tagsüber durch die leuchtende Farbe schnell den Schlüsselbund zu finden.
Nun das ABER. Sie geht schnell kaputt.
Das erste Modell hatte ich in transparent. Nach einem Jahr und 5 bis 7 Akkuladungen ging nichts mehr. Ein Druck auf den Knopf und die Lampe blieb aus. Dachte erst sie wäre leer also an das Ladekabel angeschlossen, Lade– LED ging an alles wie gewohnt.
Nach mehreren Stunden leuchtete die Lade LED immer noch und nach dem abstecken und einschalten – nichts.
Naja, kann ja mal passieren und kostet nicht die Welt also bei der nächsten Bestellung wieder eine mitbestellt.
Die hielt ein halbes Jahr, dann der selbe Defekt. Dieses Mal hab ich reklamiert und problemlos Ersatz bekommen. Doch mit der kam es erst gar nicht zum zweiten aufladen, sie ging schon früher mit ebenfalls dem selben Fehler kaputt.

Lo malo: compré tres, la primera vino abierta (o cerrada pero con diurex) y no servía, despues llegaron otras dos de las cuales una duró como tres días antes de fallar; es decir de tres lamparas solo sirvió una.

227,R2S8RAYITZZZ9C,True,Lampe porte clé USB NITECORE Tube,"Cette petite lampe porte-clés USB a tout d'une grande !
Elle mesure 5,3cm de long pour 2 cm de large et 8 mm d'épaisseur. Elle ne pèse que quelques grammes.

Sa LED blanche permet un double éclairage de 45 lumens en mode pleine puissance et 1 lumen en mode minimum.
Un premier clic sur le contacteur (gainé de caoutchouc) vous permet d'aviver le mode basse consommation, un second clic active le mode pleine puissance. Enfin, un dernier clic éteint la la diode.
Vous trouverez un petit anneau en métal qui vous permettra d'y passer une cordelette ou un anneau porte-clés.

Dans les faits, cette lampe est si légère et compacte qu'elle se fait oublier dans votre poche, sac ou sur votre trousseau.
Vous l'aurez ainsi toujours avec vous, ce qui n'est pas forcément le cas d'une lampe plus volumineuse.

L'éclairage en mode 1 lm est parfait pour se déplacer la nuit chez vous sans réveiller toute votre famille.
Le mode 45 lm est étonnamment puissant et permet d'éclairer sans difficulté l'intégralité d'une pièce de 10 à 12 m2 (portée annoncée 24m).

Gros avantage, elle se recharge grâce à un cordon de type micro USB.
Vous n'aurez donc pas à vous soucier de votre consommation en piles comme c'était le cas avec les célèbres lampes-boutons de marque Photon.
Vous pourrez ainsi la brancher sur votre PC / Mac ou sur secteur en utilisant le cordon de votre smartphone (non fourni).
La recharge sur secteur est très rapide, le témoin de charge (diode principale en mode éco, cf photo) s'éteint quand la batterie est pleine.

Elle est très résistante, normée IPX8 = IP65.
J'ai acheté plusieurs de ces lampes tant je les trouve pratiques. Je porte une des miennes en poche tous les jours, je l'ai faite tomber un nombre incalculable de fois et elle fonctionne toujours aussi bien.

Seul bémol, l'interrupteur, bien que ne dépassant que très peu du châssis de la lampe, a tendance à allumer la lampe quand vous la portez en poche avec un autre objet. L'autonomie en mode 1 lm étant de 48h, vous aurez le temps de vous enregistrer Endre compte avant d'avoir épuisé la batterie.
Dernièrement, j'en ai fixée une sur un drone Parrot. Elle ne pèse presque rien et permet cependant un éclairage conséquent.

Vous l'aurez compris, je vous recommande vivement cet objet, que ce soit pour la camping, la randonnée, le bricolage ou la vie de tous les jours. Vous l'oublierez sur votre trousseau de clé jusqu'au moment où vous en aurez besoin pour palier à une panne de courant, chercher dans votre sac ou vous rassurer dans un escalier lugubre.",france,"November 6, 2019",Ludo,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:41:36.016016,2020-11-12 14:41:36.200729,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series 45 Lumen Multi Color Pocket Flashlight,3.9,20.11,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06ZZ65855,,"#20,482 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

256,R2PIHRMMRP1K9N,True,"Helle ""immer dabei"" Taschenlampe","Gleich vorweg: ich bin so ein kleiner Taschenlampen-Freak (wie viele Männer) :)

Bisher war meine immer dabei Lampe eine kleine Photon Micro Lampe, die zwar ihren angedachten Zweck immer erfüllt hat, aber mittlerweile in die Jahre gekommen ist und einen sehr großen Nachteil aufweist: Batterien (CR2016), die zwar heutzutage nicht mehr so teuer sind, aber dennoch regelmäßig gewechselt werden mussten.

Das gehört mit der Nitecore Tube endlich der Vergangenheit an. Falls die Nitecore Tube schlappmacht, genügt ein Micro USB Kabel samt Stromquelle und der Akku ist binnen 1-2 h wieder voll geladen.
Darüber hinaus ist die Lampe auch sehr hell (gemessen an ihrer Größe) und nicht zu spotlastig, sodass eine größere Fläche gut ausgeleuchtet werden kann. Das Licht würde ich als neutral weiß bezeichnen, aber nicht kalt, was mir sehr entgegenkommt.

Die Bedienung ist narrensicher: einmal Drücken des oben sitzenden Knopfs und die Lampe erstrahlt in schwachem Licht, kurz darauf noch einmal gedrückt und die Lampe strahlt auf hellster Stufe. Das kommt mir sehr entgegen.
Hält man direkt nach dem Einschalten (einmaliges Drücken und kurz Loslassen) den Knopf gedrückt, kann man die Lampe sogar stufenlos dimmen (wer's braucht?).

Aufgrund der kleinen Größe ist das jetzt meine ""Immer dabei"" Lampe, die mich hoffentlich eine Zeit lang begleiten wird.

Tipp am Rande: drückt man im eingeschalteten (!) Zustand den Knopf für ca. 3-5 Sekunden, sperrt man die Taschenlampe. Die Lampe quittiert dieses 'Lockout' mit einem einmaligen sehr hellen Blinken und ist danach sozusagen tot (da gesperrt!).
Durch erneutes längeres Drücken des Buttons kann man die Lampe wieder zum Leben erwecken (Entsprerren). Das steht zwar alles auf der Rückseite der Verpackung, aber anscheinend treten doch viele Leute in diese Falle (zumindest wenn man auf Amazon.com die englischsprachigen Reviews liest).
Kaputt dürfte die Tube in den meisten Fällen dann aber wohl doch nicht sein, sondern per Design einfach nur gelockt (wobei ich natürlich nicht ausschließen will, dass die Lampe bei dem ein oder anderen User nicht doch eine Fehlfunktion aufgewiesen hat -> Langzeiterfahrungen habe ich nämlich noch nicht).",germany,"September 20, 2017",Ralph W.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:41:56.954042,2020-11-12 14:41:57.191549,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series 45 Lumen Multi Color Pocket Flashlight,3.9,20.11,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06ZZ65855,,"#20,482 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

電池交換が不要な点も有利。
いつ使うのか判らない物の電池交換とか面倒極まりなく、TUBEなら「充電済みを持ち歩いて、使用したら充電」の心がけで問題ない上に、そこらのスマホの充電コネクターで充電可能ですから。

ロックアウトした状態からスタート（長押し実測3.5秒）すればHiでスタートします。
OFFにするときもロックアウト（長押し実測3.9秒）させちゃえば、ボタン長押し一回で済むので、こっちの方が実用的かも。

通常時（スタンバイ）からだと、1ルーメンを経由しないと調光モードもHiにもできないので、ちょっと手間かも。

I decided to tear down my two most recent ones at the same time and noticed they both had the same issue with the positive connections coming free from the board. I was able to fix one of these by reflowing the solder, but the oldest one appears to have discharged itself into oblivion.

The positive solder connection sits between the case and the board, so flexing from normal use will always kill the device after being in your pocket for long enough.

• There is no safety to prevent it from turning on, and because the button is raised from the body, it may turn on involuntary.

➤ Thoughts
I love it. It is so small I don't feel it on my keychain. It is powerful enough to navigate a dark street or find something in a pitch black room, yet it also has a low mode for tasks that do not require much light, like reading a note, finding a keyhole, looking into a bag etc. I love the low mode, since it does not drain the battery and is bright enough for many tasks. The infinitely variable brightness is a nice touch.
It also comes with two keyrings, and most importantly, it is USB rechargeable. No need to buy those expensive and rare watch batteries. Just plug it in a USB, wait an hour, and you're good to go.
Not only do I recommend it highly, but I would also suggest buying several. Give one to all your loved ones, keep them in packs and kits, use them as zipper pulls, hand them out as gifts. They are very well-made, durable, very bright, small enough to go on your keys, and just very hand to have. Great product, at a great price.
Maybe Nitecore will release a steel casing version, for increased durability. That would be nice too.

268,R3FG8UXWST7H96,True,This light is great! Has one small issue.,"I was pleasantly surprised by this light. It was much better than I expected. The light output is very bright for it's small size on the brightest setting. I am impressed that they got this much light out of a standard 5mm LED. The low brightness setting isn't too useful, but it's nice to have. The rechargeable battery is the best part, it doesn't come with a cable but will work with any micro USB cable. Mine came fully discharged, and needed to be charged for about an hour. The charging indicator is bright and shines through the LED a little bit. It's also smaller than it appears in the picture, this is actually a good thing, as I thought it would be too bulky for my keychain. It fits very nicely on my keychain even with a lot of keys. It looks durable enough to be banging around with the keys on my keychain. Overall I highly recommend this little light. Everyone should have one of these!

UPDATE 11/2/2017:
This light makes an incredible hanging work light for working on my car in the dark. I have this light on my keychain with a carabineer and it hangs perfectly from my hood. It provided more than enough light for a quick fix in an emergency.

UPDATE 2/5/2018:
My nitecore light had stopped working. It wouldn't charge and it wouldn't turn on no matter how long it was charged. I thought it was dead, so I opened it up, which was surprisingly easy for such a small device. Just 4 small screws and a small amount of glue on the internal circuit board. I found that the positive connection for the battery to the circuit board was broken off the board. I was able to solder it back and it has worked for about 2 weeks with no issues.

269,R394RQ9SE2Z7QO,True,Convenient and durable,"I've bought about 8 or 10 of the Nitecore Tube in various colors for my own use and as gifts to family. That should tell you what I think of them overall. It does occasionally turn on inside my pocket but not nearly as often as the Fenix UC01. I've used a Tube for about three years (since around the time they first came out) and my original purchase is still going strong. The only durability issue has been that the little rubber cover for the USB port got torn off. Lack of the port cover has not affected functionality.

The Tube is available in many colors and I've bought most of them. Female family members especially like the translucent magenta color, labeled as ""pink"". I think it's the most attractive color and would be fine for a man to carry too (hey, we're all beyond the grade school ""pink is for girls"" stuff). The translucent blue is my everyday keychain light and it's also nice. The translucent ""olive"" on the other hand looks an awful sickly greenish-yellow though of course it's a matter of taste. The clear (transparent) model is kinda cool in a techy sort of way. As for the solid colors: ""Red"", so-called, is actually orange with a hint of reddish tone -- the picture in the product description is a reasonably faithful rendition of the color.

270,R22Q0ZPKR049CF,True,Great Little Light,"I'm super picky about the size of my keyring. My requirement is that is must fit in the coin pocket of my jeans. I keep three house keys, a Swiss+Tech Utility key, and a now this little light. It all fits perfect.

The low setting is enough to move around the house if it's dark, especially if your eyes are night adjusted. The high setting is brighter than I thought it would be from something this small. It's plenty to light a room, see down a hallway or light a blacked out stairwell. The light is mostly flood with no real spot. When it's charging there is a tiny blue light that's visible, it goes off when fully charged. I love that I can top it off and know that it's completely charged, unlike my other coin cell key chain lights.

I tested the run time on high and got to about 50 minutes before I noticed a real drop in brightness. At about 60 minutes it had dimmed very noticeably but was still plenty to navigate a room. After 70 minutes it had really dimmed to just a lumen or two but was still usable to navigate indoors. It was probably the equivalent of it's low setting. I stopped testing after that so as not to completely drain the battery since Lithium Ions don't like to be completely discharged.

I paid $11.99 for it in Dec '14 with Prime. I noticed the price has gone up a little. I hope they keep low, especially considering there is no charging cord included (make sure you have a micro USB cable).

It's tiny and 1 Lumen is bright enough to see inside your sleeping bag without disturbing others while camped, or a dead-of-night trip to the loo as a hotel guest. 45 Lumens is plenty bright -- possibly too bright -- for rummaging in a bag or glovebox as passenger in a vehicle at night.

273,R65ZRBGJ7BKSO,True,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series with 45 Lumens Review,"This is a review of the Nitecore Tube Keychain Light T Series with a 45 lumen output. In short, I think this is a great light that has taken a huge step forward in functionality from other keychain lights. I highly recommend this light, especially to those who already use a Micro USB to charge their phone.

Though the concept of a tiny, lightweight flashlight to attach to your keys is a great idea, I normally have stayed away from those. The 1st and main reason is that the batteries for those things are not rechargeable, and you have to go looking for a specific watch-type of battery that is not readily available such as AA or AAA batteries. This Nitecore Tube Keychain Light has fortunately resolved this shortcoming by providing a rechargeable product that uses a Micro USB connector, similar to what you will use for most Android phones. 2nd, most of the keychain lights are not that bright, though I have found a couple that were. Not only does Nitecore provide one of the brightest at 45 lumens, there are two settings (there is a button to click once for low and twice for high), and low mode is an adjustable brightness setting (via a press and hold of the button on low-mode).

Positives:
1. Bright flood style light!
2. Provides a wide area of light, not narrow as some other lights.
3. Simple function using a single button, easy access for two modes, and the low-mode has an adjustable brightness setting.
4. Rechargeable!
5. Uses a Micro USB connector to charge the battery, which is what many people use to charge their Android and other phones!
6. Small form factor.
7. Extremely light weight (0.34oz or 9.6g with battery), compared the Fenix E05 AAA light with aluminum construction (0.44oz or 12.5g without battery).
8. Water resistant seals.
9. Durable within the past couple of months of daily carry with keys in my pocket.
10. The charge indicator LED light in blue is functionally beautiful as it alerts you that the light is connected to power and charging.

Negatives:
1. I wish it were waterproof to IPX-8 standards of submersible for 30 minutes, but this is more of a wish than a negative. I go swimming and fishing often and would not have to worry if this had more protection.
2. The bright, wide angle light is so broad that it can provide some glare in your own field of view at certain angles.

Note: I have not tested the runtime of this light and will reserve comment on that aspect.

Overall, I rate the NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series with 45 lumens a very solid 4.8 out of 5.0. The only ways I can imagine improving this light is to make it meet IPX-8 standards so it is submersible and to design it to produce less glare (if it is possible as this may interfere with the light's ergonomics). I highly recommend this light and have already purchased three of these. I prefer the looks of the clear.

UPDATE July 30, 2016:
Attached are some additional pictures comparing the NiteCore Tube Keychain Light in Black rated at 45 lumens vs the Olight i3E AAA Flashlight in Black rated at 90 lumens. The beam shots are with the Olight on the left and the NiteCore on the right. The Olight is slightly heavier, though both are extremely lightweight, and noticeably brighter. Included are pictures of the glare that you get from the side view, which can be a bit blinding. The NiteCore Tube is still a revolutionary light due to being rechargeable via a Micro USB connection. I just prefer a Olight due to being so light in weight and bright despite using a AAA Eneloop battery, and being waterproof.",the united states,"March 29, 2015",G.

274,R3TIG70E4VZ089,True,Great light for your keys,"Good light for your keys for under $10.

We actually had a gift swap for Christmas at work this year with a $10 limit, so I decided to give this a shot for a female coworker. Pink seemed like the most obvious color choice so I went ahead and ordered.

Fast forward to our gift exchange, she opens it up and stares at it and says ""What is this?"". I guess she didn't like it. Even though the gift didn't go over well, here's some of the highlights of the Nitecore Tube that she will be missing out on:

For less than $10 it pays for itself quickly with its internal battery and USB charging. No more weird button batteries to buy. Just plug it in and your done.

One button switch for easy controls - just one press for low, 2 for high. You can lock out the light so it doesn't accidentally turn out and also choose the light level by being able to ""ramp"" it from 1 to 45 lumems.

It's tiny and weighs next to nothing so it really doesn't add much bulk to your keys either.

So overall, it's a pretty handy light to have on hand. 45 max lumens is not super bright but sufficient in a pinch. Definitely recommended for (almost) anyone as a practical tool to have with you at all times.",the united states,"January 6, 2018",Justin,4.0,0,2020-11-12 14:42:13.992919,2020-11-12 14:42:14.339889,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series 45 Lumen Multi Color Pocket Flashlight,3.9,20.11,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06ZZ65855,,"#20,482 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

277,R2CFEFQ2M3OMRQ,True,Almost a perfect keychain light but durability is certainly questionable...,"Pros: Compact and lightweight, rechargable, low and high lighting option, lockout mode
Cons: Durability

I bought this light 6 months ago and was pleased with it as my keychain light up until a week ago. The light would not turn on. At first, I thought that the battery might have been depleated since it's accidentally turned on in my pocket before. However, there's a lockout mode option that can be enabled help prevent this from happening. I placed it on the charger and the blue light came on as usual indicating that it was charging. The next morning I noticed that the blue light was still on, so I unplugged it and tested the light, no illumination. I emailed the manufacturer for support stating that the light would not turn on and that the device was NOT in lockout mode. I received a response a day later asking if lock out mode was enabled, charged, and if Ive tried contacting the seller. This irritated me a bit as I already provided this information in my initial email. After replying I was provided instructions on how to return the product to China for repair or replacement.
I purchased this light for less than 10.00 and it wouldn't be worth my time and effort.

I disassembled the light and noticed that the red wire was disconnected. I used my soldering iron and reattached the wire, issue resolved. The charging indicator now turns off when fully charged and the light is back to normal functionality.

In reading the reviews here it appears to be a common problem after several months of use. I wouldn't depend on this as a primary lighting souce as durability is questionable.

The price, form factor, brightness, and functions tick all the boxes for a EDC keychain light but the durability might leave you in the dark.",the united states,"April 12, 2019",FORD,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:42:14.854527,2020-11-12 14:42:15.175359,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series 45 Lumen Multi Color Pocket Flashlight,3.9,20.11,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06ZZ65855,,"#20,482 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

279,R2ZX0UOJAGDB5P,True,Excellent keychain flashlight.,"I was looking for a keychain flashlight that was as small and light as possible while still being good quality, bright, and not causing *too* many battery hassles. Most of the choices out there are either:

- Far to big to *really* be ""keychain"" flashlights
- Not actually very bright
- Cheap (i.e. don't have a switch but screw/unscrew the battery compartment for on/off)
- Use batteries that will be an absolute pain to replace

This flashlight, on the other hand is:

- Very small, about the size of a key, very light and flat
- Blessed with an actual on/off switch
- Very, very bright in the ""bright"" mode
- Rechargeable with a standard micro-USB cable, so you don't need to find odd batteries

In short, it's basically the *ideal* ""emergency keychain flashlight"" and it's worth picking up a few of them IMO.

281,R1NOSK44YSSJJY,True,Love the Lock Out Feature,"I was using a AAA flashlight and lost it in the snow, so I bought this one. A big upgrade. It takes up less real estate in my pocket, so that is great right there. It also has two different brightnesses, which is helpful. If I'm using the light during the day (like trying to look under my truck's air cleaner to see if I can find a loose vacuum line), it's nice to have that extra punch. Having the low setting greatly extends battery life and is easier on the eyes at night. Most of the time I don't need the full 45 lumens blasting my eyeballs out. Finally, it has a lock out feature. I tried pocketing the flashlight and it turned on and drained the battery the second day. Since I've been using the lockout feature, it has not once turned on. I always have light when I need it.

282,R17KPSTCI3E0WX,True,Incredible value for an awesome little light,"I've been using the Tube for a few weeks now and it's already one of the most important things that I carry on myself everyday. I used to carry a small Photon Microlight on my keychain (5 years) but it just wasn't bright enough and I hated the process of needing to unscrew the little light to change out the batteries every few months. I replaced the Photon with the Tube and haven't looked back since. I primarily use the 45 lumen option on the light and it does last a legit 1 hour but it dims to a lower lumen output around 50 minutes based on my tests. However, it's so easy to charge and you can buy the cable separately on amazon for pretty cheap if you don't already have 3 of them sitting around the house. I'm planning on buying these as stocking stuffers for the holidays because they are cheap and awesome. It probably can't replace a much bigger flashlight if you're used to carrying one but for my needs and where I live the Tube is perfect.

284,R3EZV1N0C9RXDB,True,The best little pocket or keychain flashlight hands down and I have tried many!,"The best little pocket or keychain hands down. I have owned many small flashlights and this is by far the best design and battery option out there without a doubt! The best part is two things one its a ""FLAT"" small flashlight which is a godsend as we all know most keychain small flashlights are always ROUND and bulky and a pain to keep in a pocket this one is flat and you don't even notice it in a pocket in the least. The second is the fact I don't have to buy anymore batteries!!! I can recharge this flashlights batteries just about anywhere! I can charge it in the car or near a computer or the wall outlet! whoo hoo! I even used this thing in a kids summer camp for a week as my main flashlight charging it via a Anko Solar panel USB charger! Talk about charging anywhere! When you plug it into a USB micro cable it lights up with a blue L.E.D. indicator which goes out when its completely charged (See my photos) The charging port is located on the side. This is really great because just about anyone has a Micro USB cable charger for their phone or other devices and if not you just carry a short little USB micro cable with you to charge it.
This little sucker is BRIGHT! for 45 lumens its extremely bright by that 45 lumens standards to me its more like 80 lumens in my opinion. The button is located in a good location that is in the right spot when your holding the flashlight naturally in the hand. The button also has a great DIMMER feature that goes from 2 lumens to start off with to sliding up to the full brightness of 45 lumens by holding it down when you switch it on. It can be stopped at any brightness in between from 2 lumens to 45 lumens which to me is incredible feature for such a tiny flashlight. The battery charges really fast maybe 45 min to a hour from completely dead. The battery life is really fantastic for such a small flashlight as well. I only had to charge it 1 time when I was at camp for a whole week using it as a main flashlight instead of headlamp. Its so convenient to use because its so small and light weight. To me a flashlight is only good to you if you have it on you if you don't have it on you its useless. Being this small of a flashlight and as bright as it is you can use this thing for about 90% of the flashlight jobs you need one for. Unless you need a SEARCH and RESCUE Spot light or out gator hunting in the swamp at night this flashlight will do just about fine for any job. Since I had it for the last 4 months my other flashlights are collecting dust. You would be stupid not to buy this flashlight for the price a mere 10 bucks! Its built solid too does not feel cheap at all. The key ring holder it comes with is made to hold 75lbs before it breaks so no worries of loosing your keychain flashlight like so many other keychain lights. I recommend this thing for anyone wanting a great stocking stuffer or birthday present for any man in your life.

This is incredible. They are the seller, I’m the buyer. The manufacturer told me to contact them. Typical Amazon bs.

287,RHG5E2DLMJKHW,True,"I'm pretty disappointed, I thought it was great.","Up until the other day I loved this little light. Then today I woke up to find the blue indicator charge light was on and the charge cycle never completed. The light does not work at all. I have not even owned it for a year. This product claims to be durable but I see several other reviews on here that claim the same exact problem. All of the glowing reviews appear to be people that have owned it for a very short period of time (people should not review products within a month of owning them, that isn't a true test). For what it's worth the light is only 10 bucks so i'll get over it. I will strongly consider NOT buying other Nitecore products though, not if this is what I can expect from them. Especially if I REALLY was in a time of needing that light.

I just updated my review to 3 stars from 1 star because I was able to fix the light. If your able to solder (something very small). You may be able to fix yours. The negative wire came off of it's pad so I needed to desolder and resolder it. Works good again. Although without the right tips most people will not be able to do this.

288,R1Q6QR5BPN1GN6,True,A good light if you're handy with a soldering iron.,"Unfortunately, I've had to change my review from a 5 star review to a 2 star review. The short answer is: I bought two of these lights and had to fix both of them with the same problem. I really like the flashlight, but I cannot recommend it to anyone in good conscience. It is just too fragile for its intended purpose. Keys get thrown around a lot and the light just cannot handle it.
The long answer: I bought one light for myself and one for my mother. Both attached to our respective car keys. Both stopped working in 6 months! You would give it a tappy-tap-tap and it would work for a little while, then stop working. Eventually it will stop working. You can plug it in and it acts like it's charging but it's not. One of the wires has come off of the battery pack. I was able to fix both of them (for the time being) but it's kind of a pain-in-the-ass.
To fix the broken wire, take off the back of light by removing the 4 screws. You should see that one of the wires has come loose. Originally, the wires are soldered to the bottom side of the circuit board (which is inaccessible) but I was able to solder the wire back on to the top side of the board.
Really, I can't see most consumers bothering with this, and they shouldn't need to, frankly.

Alright so I work graveyards and as such often find myself in rather dark places, carrying around a large bulky flashlight is nice when I'm outside but when I'm in a building it's just cumbersome and the reflections tend to be blinding. I've used countless small flashlights over the year and they were all garbage. When I discovered that nitecore made a small flashlight I jumped on it.

This thing is great it was essentially an infinite number of brightness settings but the two presets of dim and bright are more than enough. It will easily light up a large room or be dim enough to do some quick reading by.

291,R2VOJI7H5MRBEJ,True,A great little light,"The Nitecore Tube is a really great light. It's very light weight, rechargeable, last for long, water resistant and plenty bright.
It's about the size of a AA battery but has very low profile (about 1/4""), you won't notice it in your pocket.
The light is adjustable, low, high and custom brightness by keep pressing the power botton to your desired brightness. I'm carrying it in my pocket all the time and charged only once since buying it. I used it at work and for dog walks for about 2 months now and the battery is still good.
To give you an idea of the brightness my Galaxy S7 Edge has the brightest light I've seen on a phone so far and this little light is even brighter, at least 20% brighter. The light color is cool white. I wish it was a bit warmer.

I also have the Nitecore Tip. It's fatter, way brighter but the light is a bit warmer which is nice.

292,R2AJS4RRPTLS4H,True,The Best Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight On The Market,"This is one excellent keychain light! Rechargeable, tough, small, has a huge selection of modes, and like all Nitecore flashlights I own, it is ahead of the competition. For ten bucks, get one for yourself, friends and family members. It has a huge selection of modes but is intuitive and easy to use. The low light mode is very nice for using in the dark and not waking anyone up, as a candle or navigating for a short bit or checking maps. The bright mode is bright enough to survive in the wilderness with as long as you have a charge and is definitely very bright for this little light to get you where you need to. I'd say its more like 60 lumens.The multi-dimmer mode is nice if you want to hang it from the top of your tent as a candle, while adjusting the brightness level to something thats comfortable, covering any level between 1 lumen and 45 lumens. And the ""hold for bright mode"" is nice for a quick usage to find something in the car, quick spotting or anything like that. The flashlight hooks to a mini USB, and displays a blue light until fully charged and takes about an hour to reach full battery.

293,R11RCI93KL9FQR,True,Best Keychain Light.,"Like the placement of the on/off button. Easy to find, easy to operate. Click on once for low lumen, click twice to cycle to 45 lumens. Press and hold for 45 lumens on the spot. When on low press and hold to ramp up to 45 lumens. Charging doesn't take too long, take it off Keychain plug it in and before long its fully charged.

This thing is thin, light and tough. Been carrying mine for years now and it still works. On Keychain hardly notice it's there, no extra bulk, no extra weight. Have had several accidental turn on, not a lot while in pocket. No problem its a back light, just plug it in, charge it and your good to go.

Bought a second one for work. Clipped it to the lanyard behind my badge. Hardly ever noticed it there. Great for looking in and under machines. If I need both hands I can just bite down on it. And because it's thin and made out of plastic. Its not awkward like with a cylinder type.

294,R1XRBBUFELX1D9,True,"Amazing little light, very useful.","I love this little light! Its 45 lumen output is very bright for its size and it has a 1-hour run time at the brightest setting. It also has a moonlight mode (1 lumen) and there's an ""infinite variable brightness"" setting in between, although in reality it jumps in steps of about 5 lumens. The control system is pretty easy if you read the instructions on the packaging. I think the clear option (vs. the colored cases) is the best choice because you get a little extra light from the glow of the body.

Recharging is easy - you need a micro-USB cable (different than the more-common mini-USB) which is not included. You probably have one lying around somewhere but if not, they're cheap to buy. Just hook it up to any USB socket and watch for the charging indicator light to go out.

When I opened my flashlight I noticed it had a Chinese factory worker's hair entombed inside the case by the battery. I decided to try and open it using a tiny Philips screwdriver to open the four screws, but I failed because the screws are pretty soft and are very easy to strip. I somehow managed to completely strip two of the four screws (to the point where the head is completely smooth) so I can never open the case now. Take this as a warning not to try and open the case - or if you do, be very careful. I have a light with a hair inside and stripped screws, one of which sticks out a little because I couldn't get it back in, and yet I still love this light!

The battery is NOT designed to be user-replaceable, but I consider this a non-issue given the fact that it should last a VERY long time and the light is so inexpensive to begin with. In theory, you could replace the battery if you can source the same tiny li-ion battery, but you'd have to de-solder the old battery and solder the new one onto the board.

296,R3HOR5V68QXEPY,True,Bought 3; two died within 60 days of purchase.,"Ordered one in early 2017. Within 60 days, it died. Kept activating in my pocket. Disappointing.
Ended up ordering 2 more in July Of 2018. One died sometime in Sept. The other was a backup. Just opened it up when the first one would not operate or recharge. It had activated many times in my pocket. Lots of innovative features but not reliable enough. I'm done with NiteCore. Go ahead and try to call them. Surprise!, you will have to call CHINA! Last straw.....
Update 1-20-2020 Update:
Last one died a few days ago. In my opinion, the only reason it lasted as long as it did is that I hardly used it. Most of the times it was activated were from turning on in my pocket. I have other brand that are much smaller that I have had for 5 or more years and they still work great with no issues. AND THEY DONT ACTIVATE IN MY POCKET!
Additionally, when the battery dies, you simply replace it with an easily available replacement. The nitecore Tube flashlight can not be opened to replace the battery which is a wired rectangular shape with rounded corners.

297,R1O8B82EP1GIJT,True,Everything a keychain light should be,"If you don't have a keychain flashlight, get the NightCore Tube. It's inexpensive, unreasonably bright for something with such a small battery, has an intuitive user interface, doesn't need coin cells that cost a couple of bucks retail, and recharges with a micro-USB connector that you probably have a cable and charger for. Unlike using your phone, the Tube is something you won't mind lending to a friend, will probably survive being dropped without missing a beat, and generally works better as a flashlight.

I put a tube on my keychain and find it useful on an almost daily basis. Get home late, use it to check the depths of the mailbox. Walking into a dark house, use it to avoid colliding with obstacles and household pets. Used it as my sole light source to repair a friend's broken trunk latch on short notice.

Some will rightly complain about the glare that the tip of the LED sends back into your face; I find that holding it such that my thumb blocks that glare is a 90% satisfactory solution to the problem that's free.

I was worried the battery life would be crap, but it was only 3 days ago I noticed the light was really weak so I recharged the light for the first time ever.

305,R36P2WATO3OLGF,True,Extremely good bedside light for the cost.,"Perfect size for a bedside flashlight
I use when I have to get up in the middle of the night. My wife liked it so much she asked for one of her own.
Advantages
1) Extremely good for the price.
2) Rechargeable, and uses a standard micro USB cord (not included), so you do not need to buy a separate charger.
3) Reasonable selection of light outputs: 1 lumen or 45 lumens with a single or double click, or variable 1-45 lumens by clicking then clicking and holding.

Three minor downsides to be aware of:
1) If you put it in your pocket, the side switch is easily activated. I do not consider this to be a pocket flashlight.
2) The light beam is very broad and shines back in your eyes a bit.
3) Although it is rated to be watertight, the flap covering the USB port is not very secure. In my mind it is not watertight. This is not a problem, but it is good to know this in advance.

I've owned two of these, and both failed after about the same amount of time in the same way. One day, the light just wouldn't turn on.

Charging again produces the same behavior, charge light comes on for a few minutes, but then goes off and the light doesn't work.

Considering it's under $10 it's still cheaper than the coin cell batteries I would have burned through in a year for a normal keychain light turning itself on, but given that this product has the Nitecore branding on it I'm very disappointed in the quality, as this product just doesn't hold up long-term at all.",the united states,"March 12, 2019",Anonymous,2.0,0,2020-11-12 14:42:30.992737,2020-11-12 14:42:31.228803,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series 45 Lumen Multi Color Pocket Flashlight,3.9,20.11,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06ZZ65855,,"#20,482 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

HOWEVER:

The light is supposed to be ""water resistant"". I had it out in the rain, with the USB charging port securely latched, and it shorted out and died on me within 5 minutes. Extremely disappointing and I wont be buying again.

Nitecore just came out with a new light at a similar price point and style and a crazy lumen upgrade output of 360 LUMENS. I just ordered it and will update this review on how the two compare, however in the meantime you may want to take a look at this light as a potential better alternative:

314,R2SXZIUWSJALHI,True,Near perfect keychain light that is bright enough to be your only EDC light.,"Super lightweight and easy to carry. Very bright for the size. The high output is more than enough for most tasks, though it is lacking in range since there is no reflector. But this is about as heavy as a house key and it wasn't long ago that 45 lumens was considered very impressive for a full sized flashlight. The moonlight setting is great for up close tasks or not disturbing others. I was worried the USB cover wouldn't hold up and that the light would accidentally turn on in my pocket. After a few months the USB cover is good as new and it has turned on in my pocket only a few times. Only complaint: I wish it had a medium setting of about 15-20 lumens so you can get enough light for most tasks and conserve battery life. The infinitely variable brightness mode is not a replacement for a medium setting since you can't quickly set it and you don't know what battery life to expect.",the united states,"August 15, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:42:34.680319,2020-11-12 14:42:34.826726,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series 45 Lumen Multi Color Pocket Flashlight,3.9,20.11,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06ZZ65855,,"#20,482 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

It simply does not last. The second one I purchased stopped working after a year and I have only used it a handful of times. I relegated it to emergency use only because I wanted it to last. Still died on me. Its simply not worth it. Contacted Nite Corp and they pretty much stuck to their warranty. So I wont be buying this again.

I can confirm what others have shared, the blue charging light comes on and never turns off and the flashlight never turns on again.

325,R21QYHSR2G2NGG,True,"Great light, wish they held up better","Love it. I used to have Photon Microlights on my keychains, but using coin batteries always bother me a bit, as replacements are a pain and somewhat pricey. I have never really wanted a AAA light hanging off my keychain, since I have enough crap on there as it is. Runs for a rather impressive 1 hour at 45 lumens, 48 hours at the lowest (1 lumen) setting. It has a relatively simple interface, and I really really like the press-and-hold for momentary high option.

Like:
- 45 lumen high for 1 hour
- Variable Output
- Rechargable
- Very slim, weighs almost nothing
- 2 attachment ring sizes come with it to attach to your keyring

No Like:
- Possibility of water getting in thru the charging port, but I mean, it's a keychain light. Minor gripe.

I think it's one of the best keychain lights, and priced really well considering the specs. And who doesn't have an extra Mirco USB charging cable around? You can always borrow one at an airport, the office, etc. if you run out of juice.

EDIT 2017.12.26
I've broken about 3 of these now, and I'll have to switch to something else.

It produces a smooth, wide beam that illuminates a large area, and the color quality is decent, without any nasty purple or green tint. I like the user interface which allows quick access to low or high mode, depending on the situation. On maximum output, it reaches about 100cd in brightness. That's slightly less than a Streamlight Nano or a Photon Freedom on fresh batteries, but it maintains relatively constant brightness for about 45-50 minutes, unlike those other lights which start declining in output almost immediately. I also like that it's rechargeable by a common USB cable, so no need to buy replacement batteries or lug around proprietary cables.

The high level is great for walking around in the dark, trying to find the key hole when getting home, getting the mail at night, when you drop something in the dark.

something nice that you do not expect in a light at this price range is the fact that it has a built in rechargeable battery. And that the key ring attachment point is metal not cheap plastic that breaks after a week.

349,RCIMNEIPEUUVM,True,NightCore Tube - My Go-To Light,"What a fantastic little light!

I'm a bit of an LED flashlight junkie - I'm going on about 50 - and this is hands-down my favorite!

1) I'm pitifully night blind and this thing (these things, actually, I own five, carry two, and have given a few away as gifts) kept me from stubbing toes or tripping my way through campsites. The built in battery/charger is switch and there's more than enough light or burn time depending upon the setting.

2) the size is perfect and the shape/plastic are unique so there's never an issue finding it in my pocket. I had a ThorFire little pencil that worked well but after the eighth or ninth time it worked its way out of my pocket I gave up on it.

3) the infinitely variable brightness is super-handy once you get the hang of it. It's fantastic for task lighting when you're not expecting to perform a task.

It could be a little brighter for some people, but for the modes are ideal for me, because I'm using it in almost complete darkness usually and both modes don't mess up my night vision for too long.

This is a great utility light so far, it is mostly flood with very little throw, which is what this type of light should be. The problem with twist-on type keychain lights like the Fenix LD series is that the friction from turning on/off wears away the thin copper contact so they inevitably fail.

As others have noted, the exposed LED bulb tends to hit your eye pretty hard if you go to full power from dusk or full darkness. My solution was simply to crazy glue a small piece of non-descript black leather over the space between the ""prongs"" that shield the bulb on the left and right.

Well all in all this is really a pretty neat little light. When I first opened it I was like ""meh...just a cheap little light"" but this turned out to be a rather bright light that I end up using all the time. It kinda has some beam abilities but it's more of a flood type effect and it has two brightness settings. The first one is a dim light that gives just enough light to see if you are trying to move around in the dark but not much more than that. The second setting does a decent job of giving off some light so I often use this when working on my computer or other things at home where I can turn it on and put it down next to the area I need light.

490,R3IETOAB57NOEJ,True,Lasted 3 months before it stopped working,"Latest update:
Took the non-working flashlight apart and noticed one of the wires was no longer connected. Soldered it back on and the light works again. This is a flaw in the design and quality control of these flashlights but it was easily repaired and the light is now working again. Not adding any more stars to my review, customer should not have to perform repairs like this.

Revised review:
After having this flashlight 3 months, it has failed and will not turn on. The charging light indicates it is charging when plugged into USB cable but it will not turn on. I kept this on my keychain, it never got wet and it was not thrown around or handled roughly. There must be a defect in the one I got. It was great while it worked, but should last more than 3 months. Looking for the warranty info to see if I can get a replacement...

Perfect brightness: One click for getting the key in your door lock, two clicks for searching the yard for critters.
Very small, fits easily into any pocket.

Add a bezel around the button. I've pulled it out of my pocket many times and noticed light was on because the button was pressed when I leaned on something. Now battery is dead. Annoyed.

Add a slight bezel around the bulb. I have to hold my thumb over the edge of bulb to keep from blinding myself.

574,RIL9V8Y4MOTKT,True,The BEST Keychain Light for Every Day Carry,"Every once in a while a product comes along that changes the playing field for a particular niche. The NiteCore Tube is one of those products. It's about half an inch longer than the squeezy micro LED lights, and a couple of grams heavier. And it blows the squeezy lights away - even the new LRI Photon Freedom light that has been part of my Every Day Carry (EDC). Here's why:

1. Brighter - Yeah, it's bright. That's what happens when you use a rechargeable lithium battery that can belt out many times the current of lithium coin cells. I'd say it's as bright as the Photon's bright spot, but over a much larger area. If I wanted the same amount of light the Tube puts out using Photons, I'd need at least 10 of them. It's about the same brightness and beam pattern as the flash on my Note 3 phone. Chromatically, the Tube's light is like a florescent lamp. It's white, not yellow, nor blue.

2. Rechargeable - I'm one of those people who grudgingly use devices with non-rechargeable batteries because I worry that when I really need them, I'll have half-dead batteries. No worries now! The light charges in less than 30 minutes from my phone charger.

3. I'll keep the light on for ya - for 48 HOURS on low. I like low. It's bright enough to walk around the house in the middle of the night yet dim enough to avoid the sleep-altering effect of turning on bright lights. It's great for reading in bed without disturbing the little lady. And for when you need it, the 40 minutes of 45 lumen high beam is nothing short of awesome coming from a tiny light like this.

Now the Tube does have a few flaws:

1. It's not waterproof. The light is constructed of two polycarbonate plastic halves that are held together by four screws. There's no gasket between the halves, so water is free to flow into the case. I suppose a judicious application of silicone caulk could make it water-resistant, but it still has a USB charging port. Maybe the Tube v2.0 will have an inductive charger so it can be waterproof. Until then, I would treat it as you do your cell phone. A few splashes won't hurt, but don't take it for a swim.

2. Because the click switch is on the flat side of the light, it can turn on if you carry it in your pocket and lean up against something. A quick-witted friend asked if I was flashing him. I thought he meant my zipper was down, but it was the light on low in my windbreaker's pocket.

Since I received the Tube, it has replaced the Photon as one of my two EDC lights. I still carry the Thrunit Archer 1C for when 500 lumens is necessary, but the Tube has become my go-to light when a light is needed. Its combination of small size, extremely light weight, durability, high light output, wide beam, and rechargeability make it a five-star performer.",the united states,"April 10, 2015",J.

800,R1P3L5188FVPTX,True,Turned into a strobe,"After about of 2 weeks of barely using it (2 charge cycles) it strobes randomly when in the high beam mode.

Low power works fine, you can raise the level to about 80%, then it starts cutting out, producing a really disturbing random blinking strobe effect.

Didn't get wet, wasn't left on, was on my key ring and probably used it less than a couple of times (find a screw I dropped, or getting through kids' room without waking them up .....

My old photon light worked for 5 years and went through hell, I was hoping this would work for some time.
I guess I was wrong.

Frankly, for $9 I don't even want to start a refund process as it would cost more to send it back.

955,R3VJEAWCEGJX0,True,Great light..until I needed to charge it,I bought this light off the recommendation of a friend and was really excited to have a key-chain adjustable light. It didn't come with its own charging cable though. I would have returned it immediately if i didn't have extra cables lying around because come on really? no cable for a rechargeable device? Besides that It worked flawlessly until i needed to charge it. i plugged it in. the blue light came on...and that was it. the light never changed color o turned off or blinked or anything. So i figured maybe it was my cable. I swapped cables and now the light wont even turn on. my advice is to look elsewhere for a rechargeable device unless you have ten bucks to throw away because the light itself is actually pretty decent if it would come with a way to recharge it. who knows . maybe i just got a bad item.,the united states,"November 8, 2015",Amazon Customer,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:49:08.106982,2020-11-12 14:49:08.264569,NiteCore Tube Keychain Light T Series 45 Lumen Multi Color Pocket Flashlight,3.9,20.11,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06ZZ65855,,"#20,482 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
