1,R3SAS0X0Y15MM2,True,Not what you think,I read the reviews over and over and watched videos of the light. Pew Pew tactical had this as their #1 light for this category. It looked to good to be true and in fact was. I have used mostly high quality lights in the past in a professional and personal fashion. Streamlight and Surefire. The light came and I went through it. It feels well made and is a bit big and hard to carry on the belt. that said it fits my hand nicely. The disappointment came when I turned it on. I thought the battery must have been low on charge and that was why i wasn't impressed with the brightness. I charged it up for the full 6 hours and then got back out at night. Its not that it isnt bright but all the reviews about the 1000 lumens lighting up everything just wasnt there. I had it toggled for max then down to a long lasting 50 lumens. I grabbed my family and my Surefire G2 and went out back and compared the two. Every family member said they couldnt see a difference in the two beams or brightness. The MH25 GT is a $100 dollar light and my G2 was $59 bucks 3 years ago and I see zero difference.

3,R3QJ2B0PABBZSF,True,"Great light, good value","Great light, very bright, multiple carry options, includes tactical ring. Does emit advertised luminosity. Nitecore has been my go-to duty light for as long as I can remember.

Only two cons in my opinion, but they were fixed on the newer model

1) non-reversible clip, orientation is always head-up
2) rotating housing for selector modes

4,R2CNORBYLK3ARI,True,I like the design,"I've had different small frame flashlights. The reason I like this one the best...it's Nitecore...best I've used.

Some small ones are the same diameter, and won't stand up without falling over. The lens end is larger, and will stand upside down easily.

Easy to charge with any STD micro USB charger...no more 123A batteries. Plenty of brightness levels (including SOS and strobe). It doesn't get excessively hot after long periods of use.

The focus isn't adjustable, but that's never been an issue.

I cannot explain more, but I just like the fit and finish of this light.

6,R3GEODNF7HU4I0,True,A high quality tool!,"I have been using this light for a couple weeks now and WOW! I have a couple of well known similar TAC lights that used 4 AAA batteries and were rated at 175 and 325 lumens. We live in the woods with about an acre of cleared ground and when we take our dog out 3 or 4X each night we use these lights to keep an eye out for predators. We end up replacing the batteries every week or so when the light goes dim on those lights. With the Nitecore MH25GT I have been using the light for 10 days now on high and every once in a while I even move it up to ""turbo"" and it is still putting out way more light than the other two did! Just on high it is easily 2 to 3 times brighter than the other lights and on turbo....wow. When it does start to lose power, I'll just plug it in for the night and the next day it is ready to go again! One thing to be aware of is that it does not have an adjustable beam. However the outer ring of light is huge and the center beam is high intensity and the throw is really long. I can easily scan the tree line and see back into the woods from 250 feet.

15,R3UCW2A6FP9IUQ,True,Great unit with flaws,"This has replaced all other flashlights in my work truck. Right size to Lumen output ratio and it can charge right next to my android phone (sorry Iphony users). It has held up to many long drops of 10' plus onto concrete and shows no signs of slowing down.
-Selection of low, medium, strobe is a bit cumbersome though not prohibitively. I rarely use less than full brightness anyway.
-Belt clip pops off of the unit and falls into your pocket while your flashlight goes bouncing down the stairs if you're not careful. This could use a better design of connection than compression. To compensate, there were two clips in the box, so they're obviously aware of this issue.
-The wrist lanyard wore out and gave up after about 6 months of storing in my pocket (due to no belt clips). In reality I don't need this feature, but it could have been a bit more robust of a strap.

16,R1F16OTFPK5BRM,True,Top Shelf Lighting Product - Quality Made,"Being one of many nowadays who are classified as ""flashlight geeks"" because we are interested in high-end hand-held lighting products - I too just added this unit to my collection of flashlights (yeah as if I really needed another flashlight), right?

Bottom lines for the potential purchaser: This Model light is of very high quality of manufacture. Meaning that the machining is quality (no flashings of metal, or poor tool bit cutting), the anodizing finish is excellent throughout, the REFLECTOR itself is perfectly paraboticly shaped, finished without any milkyness or bumps in the surfaces. The LENS is crystal clear, and is supposed to be hard enough to help prevent scratches. The included HOSTER fits well and is better made than some of the other offers commonly out there. The RECHARGING port (USB type) is covered by the sliding metal sleeve which wraps around the flashlights mid-section, moving up/down after being unlocked via its internal screw threading to close/open this sleeve - which incorporates a tightly fitting ""O"" ring to prevent dust/water etc. from entering the charging port (two extra rings are also included in this package interchangeable for the Tail Cap, and Sleeve if ever needed). The light casts an even circle throughout its distance. You chose the ""Super"" lighting mode by rotating the lights head all the way down. By loosening the head slightly away from full close now enables the other functions of multiple lower intensities, strobe, etc. Is this light truly 960 or 860 Lumens (as printed with both these specs in the manual), a misprint or not?

In comparing the output of this light's advertised brilliance (960/860) using fully charged 18650 known good and new batteries - I do not have a Lighting strength/Lumen testing analyzer - BUT comparing its output to other similar lights owned, I DO NOT believe this is actually some 960 Lumens of brilliance. That being said however, it DOES provide a very brilliant light. Appears to be about the same as other 500-600 Lumen high end lighting products of good repute. SO - Should you buy this product, YES.., very well made, and this package includes a nice assortment of accessories, and is recommended.

The polystinger is a rechargeable light as well, and similar in size to this one. I received the Nitecore MH25 flashlight today and I have to say that it blows the Streamlight Polystinger away! I charged the Nitecore for a couple of hours until it was fully charged and grabbed my Polystinger from its charging cradle. I went into a dark room and turned both lights on. The Nitecore has a very bright white beam. The Polystinger had a yellowish beam that was much weaker than the Nitecore. I just purchased a new battery for a second Polystinger that I own. I wish I had saved my money and put it towards another one of these awesome lights. I love the idea of having a rechargeable light. I just received it today so I can't review how long the charge lasts, etc. I rarely write reviews but I was so excited about this powerful light I wanted to share my thoughts in case it might help someone else in making a decision on what light to buy.

59,R3PVF7HD0MRQH0,True,What a tactical light should be.,"Been in law enforcement for almost 14 years, and been faithfully carrying Surefire LED lights since their infancy. It's unthinkable that this technology has come so far, and that a company like nitecore could turn out a product that out performs and costs less than the industry leader's. A light like this would have sold for a grand ten years ago. It has a nicely focused beam that can reach out and touch a hidden suspect a good 100 yards or more if you need it. You can use it indoors and not destroy your retinas. And the battery that ships with it is a solid rechargeable battery.

I work in a rural environment these days after 13 years in a big city. I will tell you that my old SL20 with upgraded LED bulb has been retired, my Surefires are now going out to pasture, and this guy is my new primary duty light.

79,R346EYKD00AKM0,True,Great jack-of-all-trades light. Find myself grabbing this over significantly more expensive lights.,"The MH25GT is a great hybrid light that blends spill and throw quite well. Don't expect this to be the best thrower or the best EDC light, that's not the intent behind this light. This is designed to be a light you leave by the door or in a backpack instead of carrying on your person. This is designed to have a bit of throw while providing plenty of spill illumination too and it does this very, very well. When walking the dog, exploring dark areas, or generally doing anything in the dark that requires more than 10m of illumination but less than 100m, this light is always my first choice. The USB charger and the UI are both fantastic features and add even more value to this light.",the united states,"January 19, 2017",A.

84,R266TYOT5YPRN5,True,My perfect little on-the-go torch,"This flashlight is bright enough for its size. In fact, with these latest crop of LED lights one should be wary not to damage eyes and/or NV optics. No fooling around with powerful light sources, be warned!
The best part of this flashlight and that whole Hybrid series by Nitecore (other brands also provide similar feature) is easy maintainability on the go - going on a trip or an expedition always requires you to decide which of those things you need you will not take:) Cause if you take that one more item your backpack will burst open or it gonna be that last straw to break your back. So not needing to take one more charger is absolutely great! Same damn USB 5V 2A charger will go for your navigator, phone, tablet/subnote and flashlight too!
The make of MH25 is strong, with its steel lid and anodized 6xxx cast aluminum frame - it can take beating, in fact in emergency situation it can ""provide"" beating.
The size is about right too. Sure, torches made for AA bats cross section feel much more compact (for example MT22), yet as of 2014 none of them provides comparable amount of light. As for flashlights with cross section for 123 bats but with lesser reflector (like MH2C) - the beam feels a tiny bit worse, while the bulkiness is pretty much the same.
I did consider MH40 ""Thor"" for it provides twice as much charge, but it did feel too big with its huge lid.
The only thing I dont like in this (and just about any other) torch is how modes are picked by twisting. I hope they will in time meld their S.R.T. series controls with Hybrid series built-in charger... but until then MH25 is perfect for me.",the united states,"November 28, 2014",Ace of Spades,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:54:46.391033,2020-11-12 11:54:46.815934,"Nitecore MH25 2014 Edition 960 Lumens 340 Yards Long Throw Rechargeable Cree XM-L2 U2 LED Flashlight w/ Built-in USB Charger, 2300mAh 18650 Rechargeable Battery, USB Cable, LumenTac AC & Car Power Adapter, Holster",4.6,156.90,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NLL7PDA,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713eMihZC%2BL._AC_SY355_.jpg
