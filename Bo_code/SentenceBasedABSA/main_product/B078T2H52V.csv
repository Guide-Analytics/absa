0,R19BYQ1DLR8XH4,True,Great light,I like small and bright flashlights. I also like those with a built in micro-USB charging circuit so I don't have to carry a bulky charger wherever I go. This flashlight is very bright for it's small size and I was very attracted to this model since I have had the MH20 model for about a year now which is the 1000 lumen version of this flashlight. The brightness on the MH23 was significantly brighter than my MH20. The biggest bummer to me with this light is that I have owned many other NiteCore flashlights that came with their 7A batteries. This flashlight requires 8A batteries so all my battery stock doesn't help me out with this light. The bundle deal here is cheaper than buying the flashlight and two batteries separately so it helps out.,the united states,"July 11, 2018",Amazon Customer,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:25:30.517517,2020-11-12 15:25:30.677926,Nitecore MH23 1800 Lumen USB Rechargeable Compact Flashlight with 2X 3500mAh 8A Rechargeable High Performance Battery and Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer,4.5,306.99,,Tools & Home Improvement,B078T2H52V,"{'product dimensions': '11.13 x 3.18 x 3.18 cm; 360 Grams', 'batteries': '2 Lithium ion batteries required.

1,RDXITQ967H4A0,True,Compact Search & EDC Light,"This is a great light for someone who wants a pocketable search light/EDC light with good run times. I bought this to be a winter EDC light since it has one button interface and can be used with winter gloves. I have tried this and it works very well with gloves and one button keeps you from fidgeting in the cold looking for buttons on a winter walk. 3500 mah battery is great with USB charging in the light. Some might argue that USB-C and a 21700 will be more efficient and have longer run times but they will be larger lights and most everything in my carry bag runs USB and a phone cable so I did not want to carry a third cable. Very pleased with the quality and the UI that for some, may take some getting used to. I like the flashing emergency modes just in case you ever need them. Paired with a difuser and a red filter, this could be part of your emergency kit.

2,R15AF437ZCRBS8,True,"The perfect EDC light, just not for duty use.","Awesome little light, throws like a monster yet has enough spill to be really the perfect light. I carry this daily as my EDC light. Has awesome levels, uses the 18650 rechargeable which is way better and cheaper than stupid disposable 123 batteries. I don’t carry this on duty because it has a lot of features that hurt it for police work, including the side switch, and the U.I., Wish they made this exact light but with a simple clicky tailswitch (I know it would be longer which would be a plus for duty use) and it had only momentary and click to on with one single 1800 output brightness level and no external USB port. I would love to have two versions of this light. I use the low and medium settings all the time for regular EDC, but need simplicity for on the job when my life depends on it.
