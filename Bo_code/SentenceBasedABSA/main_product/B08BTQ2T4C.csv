0,R2SWG4AGUUGL22,True,Cool little--and I mean little--light,"Smaller than a 9-volt battery, this light still packs a punch. I watched all the videos, and here are some things not mentioned:
- In order to turn on the red light, press the power button for 1.2 seconds. That works, but if the light's already on, simply press and hold the power button. The white light will go off, and the red will come on. To go back to white, press and hold again.
- One video questioned why, in order to turn on the red light, one must see the white light first. That's true--the white light flashes a moment, then goes off and the red appears. It seems to defeat the purpose of retaining one's night vision. I have another small light, and to light my way to the bathroom in the dark or negotiate a hotel room I'm unfamiliar with, I placed my thumb over the lens, which produces a faint light that's almost red. The same can be done with the E03R. Place one or two fingers over the lens until the red light comes on. Night vision saved.
- Some wish the Eco mode were more powerful, but I like it. If I need more light, it's only a click away.
- A reviewer thought a mode memory would be a nice feature. In other words, the light would default to the last brightness setting used when turned on rather than the 5-lumens Eco mode. An option exists: Locking and unlocking the light is performed with a double click of the power button. Unlocking it turns the light on to the Low setting, which produces 30 lumens rather than the 5 lumens of Eco. So if one wants the light to come on at the more powerful Low power setting, simply lock the device after use.

The light does not offer a focused, concentrated beam (whiter spot in the center of the beam) like one sees on most flashlights. Rather, the E03R has an area light like that of cell phones. As a result it's more difficult to see things at distances unless the high beam at 260 lumens is activated. I don't mind that; it's a keychain light, and is designed to light one's path or walkway in the dark, and it does that very well.

The red light, on the other hand, does have a concentrated, focused beam--see photos--that allows objects farther away to be illuminated and seen. Otherwise, I suspect some objects might not be seen in a red glow. So it's a nice feature. Some videos complained that the red light does little outdoors, and that's generally true. But it works just fine for illuminating a room, finding one's way to a bathroom, performing a task in a hunting blind, etc. The red flash comes in handy for alerting oncoming traffic of one's presence.

I've found that the E03R fits nicely in my hip pocket next to my wallet, which is where I carry it since my other pockets are dedicated to my phone, pocketknife, and other EDC items.

All in all this is a handy gadget. It's easy to carry, packs a lot of power and functions, and is rechargeable via a USB Type C connection. It's a great option for keychain or EDC usage.",the united states,"August 9, 2020",Roger Hayes,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:25:45.605745,2020-11-12 11:25:45.743598,Fenix E03R 260 Lumen Rechargeable EDC Keychain Flashlight with Auxiliary Red Light and LumenTac USB-C Charging Cable,4.9,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B08BTQ2T4C,"{'manufacturer': 'Fenix Flashlights', 'part number': 'E03R+CCORD', 'product dimensions': '4.7 x 2.39 x 1.19 cm; 22.11 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.

2,RA6REO2DDW68I,True,The Build Quality is Amazing.,"The Fenix E03R Type C Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight dishes out some decent light for it's size. Having a Dedicated Red LED gives this device an edge on many competitors in this price range. The Build Quality is Amazing. This light is on my Wife's Keychain, she loves it. I may have to buy a second now :)

Features I like about this Flashlight:
CNC machined aluminum alloy housing.
260 Lumen High for Forty Five Minutes.
4 Lumen Red LED for Five and One Half hours.
TIR Optics.
Type C Rechargeable 200mAh Battery.
Battery Status LED.
5 Lumen Eco Mode for Eighteen Hours.
IP66 Dustproof/Rainproof Rating.
Lock Out Mode.
30 Lumen Low for Three Hours. I like this one the most.
Low Voltage Warning. Will Downshift as Battery Level Drops.
Red LED Flasher Mode.
Compact Size.
Decent Price.
Solid Warranty.
Includes USB charging cable. *as of August 20th, 2020

Features that could be Added or Improved on:
A second button to access modes. The long and longer presses can be confusing for a new user.

Overall, this light is a worthy choice. Having a wonderfully bright white led and the choice to run a red LED to protect my night vision is brilliant. The solid construction is fantastic. Even with the NiteCore TIP and TIP SE on the market, I see the E03R doing very well.",the united states,"September 30, 2020",Todderbert,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:25:45.890265,2020-11-12 11:25:46.023811,Fenix E03R 260 Lumen Rechargeable EDC Keychain Flashlight with Auxiliary Red Light and LumenTac USB-C Charging Cable,4.9,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B08BTQ2T4C,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vUmHfX5YL._AC_SY355_.jpg
3,R29QTG4HJ8X9F1,True,Another winner from Fenix,"I own probably 8+ lights made by Fenix and none have ever failed over the years. The E03R is another nice one and a good choice for pocket carry. I wanted a convenient light that could easily be carried in a pocket 24/7 without being any nuisance. I ordered 2, one for my wife. I noticed the single on/off button on one was firmer than the other and chose that one for my pocket use. The 4 light-intensity levels provide choices for various needs. You can light a path with the lowest level while not being obvious or disturbing to others. The other levels make searches easy and the High setting is surprisingly bright. The central beam is evenly bright and usefully wide while bleeding off to lower levels of illumination at the sides. Leaving the light on at the 3-4 higher outputs will generate some warmth but nothing of concern. The light also flashes in either a white or red beam. The red beam is more of a pencil, bright in the center with quick fall-off, but I'd prefer that it was wide like the white beam for reading and up-close work. It provides plenty of light for close searches and reading or could light a path for walking. The housing is metal and feels quite sturdy. If you want a small, useful light that takes up little room and is reliable, buy at least one of these.",the united states,"October 8, 2020",Ollie,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:25:46.028441,2020-11-12 11:25:46.161427,Fenix E03R 260 Lumen Rechargeable EDC Keychain Flashlight with Auxiliary Red Light and LumenTac USB-C Charging Cable,4.9,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B08BTQ2T4C,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vUmHfX5YL._AC_SY355_.jpg

I wanted to give it five stars, but I just don't get it Fenix, why no memory? If it remembered the last setting that would solve so many problems! For example, when I am doing astronomy or flying I need a red light, and I don't want ANY white light to ruin my night vision. If this light came back on every time in the last mode used that would be perfect...

5,R1PNSQ2T6AOC8W,True,It’s smaller than I thought. Good thing!,"I have only used this for about 20 mins to be fair. But I will give a more detailed review after some time with it. I will say I’ve owned a ton of flashlights and this little torch is no joke. It’s the perfect size. And is super bright on the highest setting. The red light is great when you want to be discreet late at night or camping when you don’t want to blind anyone. It also has a Morse code 🆘 setting in case of emergencies. Fenix has so many great flashlights but this one is perfect for your significant other,camping trips,road side car issues and so many more.

6,R3NQPUJ7F8Q4ZP,True,Worth it!,"I've been impressed with the several Fenix lights I've owned. Body is metal and looks to be durable. Arrived uncharged, which is ok for Li-ion products. Charged quickly and charging light changed from red to green when ready. Switch is slightly recessed so I don't expect this to come on while in pocket. Came with two USB-C charging cables. Split ring is small and requires some dexterity to put it on the light for attachment to a key chain.

Instructions are included. Summarized here. Hold down the button for 1 second to turn on/off, and change from white to red. Use a quick press to change from one mode to another (4 brightness levels on white, steady/flashing). To go to red upon startup, press and hold button for about 2 seconds.
