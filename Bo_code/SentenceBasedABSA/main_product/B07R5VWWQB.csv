0,R36GT4AY815M9T,True,Hold Buttons for two seconds to turn on,"I've been a consumer of Nitecore lights for a while, especially their keychain ones. They make quality products. They make good chargers as well. (There is one on my desk right now charging my 18650's) I am a big fan of all keychain lights and have tried many brands. I always come back to my Nitecore TIP light. There are some brighter ones, or smaller ones, or bigger batteries, but that one just works great. I even have it on a mini magnet for quick deployment. So, when I saw the new version the TIP2, I thought - great! they put a magnet on already, clever, that will make pulling it off my belt quick, and it's twice as bright!

Well, then they did the silly thing that is resulting in my bad review. You have to hold the button for two seconds to turn the light on. That's not a little bit, two full seconds. It doesn't seem bad when you're sitting on the couch, but when you need light quickly, it feels like forever. And, the buttons are very small, so, by feel sometimes I'm not sure if I'm actually pushing it, then I have to wait two seconds, and if it didn't turn on, I fiddle around and try pushing another place. If you are out at night walking the dog and hear a critter, by the time you get the light on the sun is coming up! Haha, well, no, not really, but to me, that's not how a light should work.

It's super annoying. It's made it so I don't really use it, especially at work, where I use my original TIP about 100 times a day. I have three I rotate on a charger so I always have one ready. I feel like the two second delay is unnecessary as well cause the buttons don't really protrude. Even if the light turned on immediately there would be basically zero chance of turning this light on by mistake because the buttons are almost flush and they are tiny. I don't know why they would program the two second delay. Someone in the design department made a bad decision. The buttons are more flush than the TIP and even with the TIP being instant on, I never turn that on accidentally. Thing is also, it would be so simple to rectify. The light already has a demo mode, that's how it ships. It turns off after 30 seconds. All they have to do is make the demo mode use the two second delay and the non-demo mode use instant on.

One other slightly annoying thing, they made the receptacle for the magnet, (the cup part that attaches to the keychain) too deep, so you gotta fiddle with it a little to get it back attached correctly. Otherwise it sort of grabs on crooked. Which if it's on your belt, and like me you have a little belly in the way, you might not notice. Hehe

Maybe the two second delay won't bother you, and if so, then maybe try out this light, and comment if you disagree. It's reasonably priced, pretty cool, small, and is very bright. But, I will continue to use the original TIP.",the united states,"July 13, 2019",Kevin V.,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:54.194573,2020-11-12 14:37:54.441801,NITECORE TIP 2 (TIP2) 720 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Micro-USB Charging Cable,4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07R5VWWQB,"{'manufacturer': 'NITECORE', 'part number': 'TIP2+UCORD', 'product dimensions': '6.25 x 2.69 x 1.35 cm; 38.27 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.

1,R3CL4CU698Z1AU,True,Long power-on delay is a dealbreaker,"For context, I previously owned and very much liked the TIP 1. I bought this because I lost my TIP 1. I suspect the cat stole it.

The TIP 2 is a massive disappointment compared to the original. It has many issues - some minor, one dealbreaking. In order from least important to most important:

* The TIP 1, when swapping between brightnesses, would change instantly from high to low. The TIP 2 instead quickly fades down when switching from high to low.

* Though rated for 720 lumens vs. 360 from the TIP 1, I don't think it's noticeably brighter than the TIP 1 at all. I haven't been able to do a direct comparison as my TIP 1 is still missing, though.

* The TIP 2 is much more symmetric than the TIP 1 - which makes figuring out which end is the front and which is the back difficult to do in the dark, particularly if you remove all of the accessories like I do.

* The TIP 2 places the power and mode buttons on the edge of the unit, instead of the face. This is slightly less usable than the original and forces me to hold it in a less natural position.

* It's no longer possible to use turbo mode without holding down the mode button - in the TIP 1 you could get it to stay on by long-pressing the mode button from the off position. Now it just instantly turns off when you let go, no matter what.

* There's no longer a button shortcut to instantly turn on the lowest brightness mode. In the TIP 1 you did this by long-pressing the power button. This is no longer possible, as long-pressing the power button has a new function, detailed below.

* You have to hold the power button down for about 1.5 seconds (As measured with a stopwatch) to turn the flashlight on normally at all. Notably, you only have to hold the mode button for about 0.5 seconds before turbo mode turns on - so that's actually the quickest way to get light in a hurry. I read this in the reviews before I purchased the TIP 2, and thought I'd be able to get used to it, but I really can't - it absolutely kills the handiness and convenience of the original, and feels like much longer in practice. They already have the useless demo mode option you can switch between - they should have just locked this design defect behind a separate mode, like that. If not for this point I could have forgiven all of the other issues and learned to love the TIP 2. Absolutely ridiculous.

My review is overwhelmingly negative, but there are a few positive points. Most notably, the magnetism is pretty handy (And fun to fidget with), and being waterproof is definitely nice to have, just in case.

My verdict: Hard pass, get a TIP 1 instead.

Editing this to say that I did eventually find my TIP 1, and the TIP 2 is noticeably brighter when they're used side-by-side. Still annoying the TIP 2 can't stay in turbo mode without holding the button down, though.

One final edit in September 2020 just to note this is all still true, even nearly a year later: I use my TIP 1 on a daily basis, and the TIP 2 only ever sees use when the TIP 1 is lost or charging.",the united states,"October 6, 2019",zlezorqw,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:54.449796,2020-11-12 14:37:54.701503,NITECORE TIP 2 (TIP2) 720 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Micro-USB Charging Cable,4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07R5VWWQB,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tGPhGIzXL._AC_SY355_.jpg
2,R2PWBSHDBRIYOQ,True,"Nitecore revamps the ""TIP"" ... and makes it brighter!","Here's the Nitecore TIP2, which is an update from the original TIP. This time it has two LED's and up to 720 lumens.

Basically you can carry it two ways. Attach it to your belt or pocket with the clip, or hang it from a key chain. The base is magnetic, and as you should be able to see from the second photo above, there are two small magnets on either side of the USB charging port. This area is exposed once the tail cap has been pulled off. Therefore, in order to charge it, the cap needs to be removed each time. If you want to use it as a pocket light, and have the base stick to something metallic, then you might consider leaving the cap off permanently. Just be sure if you do that, that no damage comes to the charging port.

It also three modes, low, medium, high...plus turbo. There's also two operating modes, ""daily"" & ""demo"". In demo, it only stays on for 30 seconds at a time. In ""daily"" it'll run for as long as you need it. To turn it on, press and hold the power switch. To advance the mode, press the mode switch. To toggle back & forth from ""daily & demo"" press and hold both switches simultaneously. You can only get to turbo mode by pressing and holding the mode switch, (whether it's on or off) and when the button is released, turbo ceases.

While the battery is being charged, three tiny LED's located between the switches, flash in blue, then turn steady when finished.

The Nitecore TIP2 is mighty small and mighty bright! I recommend it :-)",the united states,"May 20, 2019",RBW,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:54.709500,2020-11-12 14:37:54.951164,NITECORE TIP 2 (TIP2) 720 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Micro-USB Charging Cable,4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07R5VWWQB,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tGPhGIzXL._AC_SY355_.jpg
3,R2KMDEW306LCAP,True,Slight improvement over earlier versions,"Pros: Greater brightness (720 vs 360 lumens in the Nitecore TIP 2017 because of two LEDs), although 2x brightness is
less than you would think
Waterproof. Kinda'. The major ingress point in the prior version was the USB charging port. That port is now
covered with a strong magnetic cover, although I don't see any actual rubber seal.

Cons: There is about a 2 second delay before the light turns on. Probably my biggest gripe
The switches are located on the narrow side of the light.

4,R3E23RZDXHK8U0,True,Buy without hesitation,"As soon as I saw there was a TIP I looked at the specs watched a review and bought 2. I have no regrets. I’ve has the Tube, and the TIP. Last 3 key lights have all been Nitecore. They last, they are durable, and they are bright and reliable. I pretty much love everything about this knife. The two things I don’t like are the recessed buttons and the delay in coming on. It’s just because I’m so used to the other models. The two things I do not like however are functional. They do serve a purpose that I do like so I just deal with it. And that is so you do not accidentally turn on light in your pocket. I removed the pocket clip, and I removed the key chain (very sturdy btw, not junky) and I just use the small o ring. It works great on my cable key Chain that way. But overall absolutely love these lights. They will be staying on my keys for quite some time.",the united states,"June 4, 2019",Adam,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:55.181914,2020-11-12 14:37:55.481875,NITECORE TIP 2 (TIP2) 720 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Micro-USB Charging Cable,4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07R5VWWQB,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tGPhGIzXL._AC_SY355_.jpg
5,R3IWQH8K7H6GD2,True,Great for EDC,"This is a great EDC light. I find that I stash it in my backpack more than pocket. Don't get me wrong, it is pocket-sized (and BRIGHT) but the shape of it suits more for using the clip to attach onto something vs. riding in a pants pocket. I have not worn down the battery enough (after a few weeks) to comment on its longevity beyond saying that I have not worn it down after a few weeks... so that's pretty good on its own.

If you are considering this for a ""self defense"" light, it's not your top choice. The same safety feature that keeps it from turning on in your pocket - namely a ""depress and hold the button for over a second to turn it on"" - also means that it does not have an instant-on capability. So that's a consideration depending on your intended usage.

Super cool light and I'm glad I bought it. The brightest setting is ""momentary on"" which is actually pretty great. The ""normal"" bright setting is plenty bright for most applications, and the lower settings are useful for other applications.

Overall, really impressed by this light. Haven't tested the limits of the battery or subjected it to extreme weather conditions, but digging it so far.",the united states,"June 3, 2019",Thomas O'Leary,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:55.489864,2020-11-12 14:37:55.732268,NITECORE TIP 2 (TIP2) 720 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Micro-USB Charging Cable,4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07R5VWWQB,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tGPhGIzXL._AC_SY355_.jpg
6,R2QB7XMQQ7EU42,True,Love it so far. Definitely recommend it.,"I've only had this about a week, but I love it. I bought this to put on the key fob for my '05 Prius and it's a great fit. Without the pocket clip, it's almost exactly the same length and thickness, but a little narrower.

It feels solid and I like that the buttons are on the side. I believe it will not to turn on accidentally in my pocket. This unit is replacing a well used MecArmy SGN3 which has become unreliable due to wear. The MecArmy was smaller but turned on unexpectedly, draining the battery. The TIP2s is a good size, is brighter much brighter than the SGN3, and best of all, has the magnetic base.

I work inside metal equipment cabinets and the magnetic base is a big plus. I can pull it off the keychain and stick to the cabinet to light up my work area. Even though you can't tilt it to aim the light, I believe it is bright enough to light up the area I'm working on. You just have to find the right spot... and remember to pick it up again when you're done!

I haven't had the chance to test the run time, but if it matches the specs, I will be happy. Recharging was easy once the cap comes off. The first time I removed it, I thought I would break it from pulling too hard, but the hasp attaches to a metal plate inside the cap and it's very strong. The magnet is strong enough that I am not worried about the flashlight falling off.

The TIP2 meets or exceeds all my expectations so far. If anything changes over time, I will update this review.",the united states,"May 8, 2020",T-42,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:55.740293,2020-11-12 14:37:55.981331,NITECORE TIP 2 (TIP2) 720 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Micro-USB Charging Cable,4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07R5VWWQB,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tGPhGIzXL._AC_SY355_.jpg
7,R2JZCR28DIADFH,True,Complicated,"It charges quickly. It’s incredibly bright. It appears to be bomb proof. The two button, demo/daily/on/off/brightness/turbo/switch/button switches seem to operate completely randomly. I’m sure there’s a learning curve and in just a few days I’ll have it all figured out but it’s a flashlight. You know, with an on/off switch? Only that’s not how the switches work. Between long/short press and both button/single button combinations and demo/daily mode there seem to be at least a dozen possible outcomes. I followed the teeny tiny printed instructions to the letter and there all kinds of blue blinking lights and flashing of the main light but I couldn’t actually turn the light on and shine it at stuff. I think I figured something out that will allow me to turn the light on and switch through the power settings but it’s tricky and has nothing to do with the written instructions. I suppose there’s a YouTube tutorial on how to operate the thing and it’s probably half an hour long but I used to know how flashlights worked and I feel bad about my antiquated skill set. Maybe I can attend a weekend seminar on how to turn a flashlight on and off.

8,R25VZIZJAMNNTM,True,Waiting for TIP 3...,"This small light is very bright for its size. The pocket clip (plastic) should be of higher durability. The rear magnet is WAY TOO STRONG since I bend the small metal clip when attempting to remove for charging (or tail-standing) - EVERY TIME. Both Low Mode and Turbo should be able to be accessed by separate single touch. I will say that the brightness selections are well spaced though.

Also I believe that by now all new rechargeable devices should be using the much improved USB-C connector other than the ill-designed micro-USB (with that imperceptible trapezoid shape!). I will not be recommending the TIP2...Especially at this price point.

I guess my worst fear is losing it because it wouldn't take much to and you'd probably never find it unless you were lucky so my advise is if your prone to losing or misplacing things it's probably not for you.

11,RN0RMX6N4LM7O,True,Worth its price,"Wow, I was just amazed about how small it feels on your hand. No doubt you can use on your keyring. Just love it.

Most of the time I used the 2nd lowest brightness level, so battery life is more than enough. Using Turbo power would drain battery quite faster, but I don't really need that much brightness.

Only quirk (but I can live with it) is that regular power on time is something like 2 seconds, just as other reviewers has already mentioned. Not a deal breaker, but it's (a feature) something hard to justify. I supposed this was intended to avoid turn it on by accident, but even so that much time seems unnecessary.

94,RDDKALNU2GM5S,True,You just can't make some people happy....,"I just got this light and so far I'm very happy with it. I have an original Tip and this seems like a nice improvement. What I don't understand is why people complain about having to press the power button for 2 seconds to get it to turn on, then turn around and also complain about it not having a lockout mode....which on the original Tip takes TWO hands pressing BOTH buttons for two seconds to get it out of lockout mode and turn it on.

One of my biggest issues with the original Tip was that when the light wasn't on lockout mode it would turn on in my pocket all the time. But when it was on lockout mode I couldn't pull it out and turn it on using just one hand.

With the way the Tip 2 works, so far it hasn't turned on in my pocket and I can take it out and turn it on with just one hand instead of needing both hands to get it out of lockout mode like I had to do with the original Tip.

I tried keeping the original Tip in my pocket without being in lockout mode so I could turn it on with one hand but it would always turn on in my pocket and if it was set on high I'd unknowingly be walking around looking like the tip of my ....well..... my thing....lit up like ET's finger or Rudolph's nose. It was quite the conversation starter with the ladies.

Basically, having to hold the power button for two seconds is a non-issue. It's a good alternative to lockout mode and I can turn it on with just one hand. And if I need light faster, I can simply press the mode button and in one second or less, turbo mode comes on.

As for the rest, I've read some complaints about the strong magnet on the tailcap. If you keep things in your pocket that are sensitive to magnets I can see this being an issue. I keep my phone in my other pocket so I'm hoping it doesn't become an issue with anything else I might put in my pocket. Not sure if it'll affect my access card for work which I keep in a badge holder and sometimes put it in that pocket.

I do like that the light is easily removed from the magnetic cap. I need a light at work all the time and with the original Tip it was a pain having to hold my keys along with the light.

The light output is great. Obviously it's a very floody beam and doesn't throw very far but it's a keychain light. I have plenty of other lights for more serious uses. It's a great light for my needs at work though.

The size is pretty much the same as the original Tip.

My only complaint is the price. It's definitely steep for a keychain light but if it lasts until the next new ""ooooh...shiny"" thing comes along, i'll be happy.",the united states,"September 5, 2019",MiamiGuitarMan,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:38:52.431290,2020-11-12 14:38:52.679912,NITECORE TIP 2 (TIP2) 720 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Micro-USB Charging Cable,4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07R5VWWQB,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tGPhGIzXL._AC_SY355_.jpg
