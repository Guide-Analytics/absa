3,R20CPHZBVMPUA0,True,"Super Bright Tiny Light, but it's not waterproof","I always carry two lights - a big one for daily use and a tiny one as a backup. You never know when your big light will fail. So I was very pleased that Nitecore put together this minuscule half-ounce powerhouse of a flashlight. It's good enough to use as a daily light while being only half the size of a Bic lighter.

The 380 lumen turbo mode is activated as long as you hold the top button. Three other well-spaced light levels are available by holding the bottom button for 2 seconds. You switch between the levels by tapping the top button. The light remembers the level between activations, so if you turn it off on low, it turns on in low. The lowest light level is more than enough to read by, and with 2-1/2 days of run-time it's like the Energizer bunny. If you tap the top button while the light is off, it flashes the battery level - once for +25%, twice for +50%, and three times for +75%.

The beam pattern gives a smooth 170-degree flood pattern with an evenly bright spot about one foot wide at 3-feet. It has a nice linear fall off from there and no color fringes. The light color of the CW version is essentially the same as a standard florescent lamp.

I gave it 5 stars, but there are a two negatives. It has turned on in my pocket several times. I have to leave it in demo mode, which automatically turns off the light after 30 seconds. At least it's easy to shift to normal mode by pressing both buttons for two seconds, but I wish Nitecore would change the turn on behavior. Instead of having to press the ON button for two seconds, make it three quick presses in less than a second. That should stop accidental activation and significantly speed up the turn-on time.

The second reason is that this light is only water resistant, not waterproof, which means if you fall in the pool with it, it's probably not going to end well for the light. If my cell phone can be waterproof, I don't know why this little light can't pull off the same feat. Now everything in my daily carry is waterproof, so this light can't be the exception. I keep it in a waterproof sleeve I made from two pieces of heat-shrink tubing.

If you are looking for an unobtrusive backup light for your everyday carry, this is a great candidate for it's price, size, and performance. If the folks at Nitecore keep innovating like this, I will keep buying their products.",the united states,"January 20, 2018",J.

4,R3E0M6PO08IAIF,True,Better than previous keychain lights by nitecore,The main problem with the other models of nitecore keychain lights was that they kept coming on while inside my pocket. Battery life would drain and you‚Äôre left with a dead battery. This model does not seem to have that problem. You need to push the button for 2 seconds before the light activates. Much less chance of accidentally activating the light. My only negative thing I have to say is that the light is not as bright as my previous nitecore keychain light that was actually rated at lower lumens. Don‚Äôt get me wrong... this is still an extremely bright light that will amaze anyone standing around when they see it came from a keychain light.

6,R2IDZ1TP230D0L,True,Amazing little light.,"Amazing little flashlight. It has three brightness levels plus the extra bright ""turbo"" mode. It charges with a USB cable which is included by the seller as it's packed separately from the flashlight. You hold the power button for two seconds. This helps to prevent it from turning on and remaining on while in your pocket. The mode button activates ""turbo"" which only stays on while you hold the button. While charging the the buttons will flash ib blue. When the battery gets low the buttons will flash to let you know it's time for a charge. I haven't run it through a full cycle yet. It's all on the instruction sheet which explains the operation fully.

Well, now that I've had it for while I find it gets turned on in my pocket sometimes and if you don't see your pocket illuminating you will feel it getting hot. So I'm not so happy with this light any more. I'll look for something that doesn't get turned on by itself (different type of switch).",the united states,"April 2, 2018",Mike C.,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:21:57.512233,2020-11-12 14:21:57.687947,"Nitecore TINI 380 Lumens USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with Lumen Tactical Charging Cable - Available in 7+ Colors, Aluminum, Copper or Stainless Steel",4.3,53.19,,Tools & Home Improvement,B076QJMK4X,,"#321,393 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

7,R284YAH8C1CJXP,True,What a disappointment! I want a TIP instead.,"I bought this light to replace my NITECORE TIP. I used my TIP in a dark room to light stuff up obviously because it is a flashlight. My TIP was instant on/off and when i need to read something it was fast. This light is not instant, it has a 2-3 second delay before the light comes on. It may not be a problem for most but makes this a piece of crap to me. I bought the copper unit and it looks great. But this 2-3 second delay before the light comes on is ridiculous. Aside from the delay it is a nice unit but my recommendation is a TIP.

8,RSXDQ7XX8HNWG,True,"Nice light, but overpriced considering the features it lacks.","Purchased to replace my Manker LAD, which disappointingly died after 1 year with light use. The LAD had red lights as well as white, strobe/SOS/beacon function - Nitecore should add this to be competitive. Turbo mode cannot be left on - you can only use it while holding down a button.

One nice feature is that you can use it while it is being charged.

The owner's manual lists the USB charging cable as a semi-rigid, flexible type - the sort that would have been useful if using this light while working on a laptop in the dark and simultaneously powering/charging it with the USB port on the laptop, as it allows you to ""stand"" the light up and aim it in any direction, which the Tini could do because it is so lightweight. However, Nitecore instead sends it with a short, cheap charging cable, in a separate package, indicating that they intended to manufacture and ship it with a better cable but changed their minds.

9,RA231F2BHCSJA,True,Another great leap in keychain lights from Nitecore.,"Wow. Just when you thought Nitecore couldn't up their game after the TIP series... These light are really not much bigger than the button battery plastic Protons. They put out an amazingly bright, well diffused beam. They really couldn't be any smaller and still be easy to operate with human hands. There is a 2 second delay before the light comes on after you push the button but I personally do not find this to be an issue. If you need quicker light, there is a half second delay when you push and hold the mode button before the very bright turbo mode comes on. It goes off as soon as you release the button and this too is a feature to prevent accidental discharge which was an initial problem for the Tip series. There is now a small rubber insert over the charging port to improve waterproofness, but looks like great care should be exercised in order not to damage it. As with the previous model I don't believe the color finish will last very long jiggling around in you pocket with your keys, but the metal is strong enough to resist any real damage. Is it perfect? No. But it represents a real value at its price and Nitecore deserves praise for its design efforts and continuing improvement of this concept.",the united states,"December 1, 2017",Steven Schwartz,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:21:57.999968,2020-11-12 14:21:58.149314,"Nitecore TINI 380 Lumens USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with Lumen Tactical Charging Cable - Available in 7+ Colors, Aluminum, Copper or Stainless Steel",4.3,53.19,,Tools & Home Improvement,B076QJMK4X,,"#321,393 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

10,RMVKN2NFONOW9,True,Noisy Cricket of the Flashlight World.,"The light is BRIGHT!
The copper is ACTUALLY COPPER!
The weight is A BIT DISAPPOINTING. It is feather light.
The UI is PRETTY GOOD. Just don't forget to hold both buttons down at the same time or else it will stay in display mode where it will only stay switched on for like 20 seconds and then shut off.
The fit and finish is LACKING - The silver plastic is a terrible choice and the buttons just don't do it for me. You can see a gang of photons leaking out through cracks in the body where things aren't lining up like proper NITECORE things should.
The battery life is GREAT.

11,R25U5JAL6AYR4C,True,Wonderful light but fatal operational flaw. Not for me.,"I have carried the Nitecore TIP for a long time and consider it one of the BEST small lights available. I thought I would also try the smaller TINI 360, and ordered two - one for myself and one for a gift. Well. As for the performance of this little light, it is superb after you get used to holding the ""ON' button down for a few seconds before the light actually illuminates. The levels of brightness and the internal battery life make this an exceptionally nice piece of gear. HOWEVER- it will never be an EDC for me. REASON- the two very very tiny buttons which control on/off and brightness levels, are so close together that it is all too easy to hit both at once, without even realizing it. Why does this matter? Well- if you hit both at once, the light goes into a 'demo mode'- which means that after 30 seconds, the light goes off. Dark. Not good. Now, it IS easy to get it back to the operational mode by holding both buttons down until the light flashes twice. THEN you can use it as you intended to. I am not certain why this feature was built in, and I know of no way to disable it - which would be great! But as it is, if youa re in any critical situation - working under the hood of a car at night looking for a leak, walking through a totally dark house, whatever - having the light unexpectedly turn off, then having to have the presence of mind to hold both buttons down and wait for the two flashes, then pressing the on button and waiting those few more seconds for it to light- it is nust not something I am comfortable relying on. So if, knowing these details, you opt for this little micro-light, go for it. For me, I am staying with the slightly larger but utterly dependable TIP.",the united states,"November 25, 2019",J3,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:22:00.549609,2020-11-12 14:22:00.699259,"Nitecore TINI 380 Lumens USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with Lumen Tactical Charging Cable - Available in 7+ Colors, Aluminum, Copper or Stainless Steel",4.3,53.19,,Tools & Home Improvement,B076QJMK4X,,"#321,393 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

12,RX9YBM1KRG6VT,True,I have a new EDC light,"I have carried a Foursevens Preon, with 10440 LiIon. This combo outputs close to the same output as the TINI, but the 10440 requires a dedicated external charger, and there's no over-discharge protection, so I've killed bunches of those cells. It's a hassle.

The TINI is smaller and lighter than the Preon, it has more modes, a better UI, and is more ergonomic in every way. No brainer.

Still, there are some things not to love about the TINI.
1. I hate mode memory. It means when you turn it on you never know what level it will come on at, it'll be whatever level you left it at, probably days or weeks ago.
2. There is a substantial delay from the time you begin pressing the power button to the time the light comes on. This is understandable, so as to avoid accidental power-on in your pocket, nonetheless, it's an annoyance.

(Semi-)instant-on turbo mode is great, though.

I like the tint of the Preon better, and the beam shape, but you know what, I don't obsess about those things anymore. I just need to see, and I can't be hassled with unprotected 10440's and external chargers, anymore.

I would not recommend for carrying inside a pocket. With just keys in the pocket with it, the Tini came on multiple times. If you let it dangle from your keys on the outside of a pocket, it might be fine.

Even with that, it's rechargeable so it's not like you're wasting batteries. It also has a setting where it will turn itself off after 30 seconds or you can choose to manually turn it off.

14,R1ZZ084XVERZ0R,True,"My favorite flashlight. Insanely bright, insanely small, great battery life, mildly annoying button","This is a superb keychain light. It is super small, you won't even notice it in your pocket. It gets insanely bright on turbo mode and very bright on high. The battery holds a charge for a long time and seems to last forever on medium/low brightness which I find I use the most. USB charging is very convenient, I last charged mine over 3 weeks ago, have used it occasionally, and its still reporting 75+% charge.

Low brightness is perfect for a dark room at night or as I used it to navigate a dark room to avoid waking a sleeping baby! Medium brightness is perfect for any nighttime situation and is in the range of what most people would think of as ""a normal bright flashlight"". High brightness is really bright, great for finding dropped objects in dim locations even on bright days. Turbo mode is insane for a flashlight of this size, it is blinding even indoors during the day with the lights on. The performance given the size will wow people. It performs like a light 10x its size.

The light remembers its previous brightness when you turn it off and on. It will tell you its battery charge in 25% increments by blinking the LEDs when you press the mode button. You can only use turbo brightness by holding the button, I assume because otherwise it would overheat or run down the physically small battery too quickly. It has an auto-off (30s) demo mode which seems kinda useless but is easily turned off by pressing both buttons after which it can be forgotten about.

I have not tested water resistance but it does not seem likely that it is too water resistant. I think it would survive some splashes and rain, maybe a quick dunk, but probably not a soaking.

The only downside is the slightly annoying power button. They put it on a delay to avoid it being activated in your pocket and draining the batteries. The issue is the delay is a bit on the long size, ~2.5 seconds, and it feels annoying to pull out the light and wait for it to turn on compared to most lights which activate instantly. In practice I find this isn't as much of an issue as other reviewers make it out to be but it may be a big issue for some.

Overall I highly recommend the Nitecore Tini.

15,R340NMBH6G77UJ,True,A great Lightweight Light,"I bought several of these last year as stocking stuffers. They all have survived as keychain lights. I purchased another this season for my own use to replace a fenix keychain light, which is a backup to a larger Olight baton series

First off This light with the quick release weighs in at between 0.5 and 0.75 ounces. (16 gms). The Stainless one weighs slightly more, of course.
The beam is quite floody, and I usually leave it on the medium setting, but at the low setting it is useful for nearer distances, when the brightness of the other settings is too bright.
Remember, this is not a 'primary' light source. BUT you have one hour on high mode, 4 hrs on medium. I tested the high mode, and it went past the one hour easily, but was warning blinking the blue buttons telling me it was low.

On the High setting it is plenty bright for any task you would use a keychain light for. Turbo is momentary only, and is super bright (380 Lumens)
It has two modes of operation:
1. 'Demo' which limits the runtime to 30 seconds. Useful to prevent it from discharging in a pocket, and
2. 'Daily' mode for continuous operation. Switching between those two modes is simple
At first I found the fact that to turn it on you have to hold the on switch for about 2 seconds before it turns on annoying. It is there as additional protection against it turning on unwanted. I'll get used to that though.
I'm getting used to having one switch as on/off and the other for output settings
I am a bit disappointing at only the 5.4 water resistance, but it should be adequate for keychain use. Nightcore should revise this product with one that keeps the same size/weight, but has a better IPV rating, IMO

16,R3QN8G7BAPL381,True,Let there be Nitecore,"I've been a real estate rehabber for a long, long time. I'm constantly inspecting abandoned buildings, where the electricity is not to be had, and hazards abound. Back in the day, that meant I had to keep a baseball bat-sized Maglight in my trunk.

17,R2O3TICD3DPQVI,True,Very capable light in true edc form.,"While looking for a new edc light i stumbled on this nightcore tini. After some thought i decided to try it out. By far one of the best drunk amazon purchase yet! Based on photos i had expected it to be bigger and doubted that it would be comfortable on a key chain. I was surprised to see that in fact that its smaller than my key fob and goes unnoticed while in my pocket. Its not a thrower. Although bright with maximum 380 lumens the lense is a bead reflector type that disperses the light allowing you to easily light up a room. I waited for night to try it outside before writing this and i was impressed. On turbo you can easily see out to 40ft. Light definition after that deteriorates shortly after that. If you expect farther penetration you obviously have high expectations. Also while in trubo mode it gets hot! You can feel it warming up after about 10 seconds. After first noticing the heat it starts heating up rather quickly. After about 30 seconds i was scared to break it so i let off of turbo mode. The photo of my mango tree is from 25-30ft and the one with the vehicles the van is at 5ft the red jeep wj is at 10ft and the black jeep wj is at about 35-40ft. That being said i am very impressed and over the moon happy about my new nightcore tini! I will definately get more as gifts for my family, friends, and even coworkers.

19,R1IIPUVCT6WFAR,True,Nice small bright light,"I like this light a lot it is very bright, the 4 light modes are very nice. If you want light fast then just press & hold the top button for turbo mode and when you let go of the button it turns off. I have it in demo mode (I have it on my keychain) so if the bottom button is pressed accidently it only stays on for 30 secs & automatically turns off, so you don‚Äôt have a dead battery when you need it. You can see the charge amount by pressing the top button briefly & it will flash 3 times above %50, 2 times less then %50 and 1 time less then %10 charge remaining, very good feature so you are not caught with a dead battery when you need a light. Now when using to turn on, hold the bottom button for 2 secs & it will turn on to level 1,2 or 3 depending on what it was set at when you turned it off, after 30 sec it will turn off but if you hit the bottom button again within 3 secs it will stay on until you turn it off and will go back to demo mode. When the light is on you can hold the top button for turbo and when you let go of the top button it will go back to the setting it was on. When recharging the light will flash to let you know it is connected & charging, when it stops flashing it is fully charged. It takes about 1 hour 45 mins to charge if less then 10%.

This thing is almost too small, I'm a little afraid of losing it! I haven't actually had to recharge it while on the couple of weekend trips I've brought it on, it lasts at least a few days of casual use. It's plenty bright for middle of the night bathroom breaks, walking around trails at dark, finding things in my tent, etc. Because of the small size it can be a little awkward to hold and I've accidentally turned it off or had to fiddle with the controls more than seems necessary.

24,R3HF5B11Z2O0OL,True,Too hard to recharge. Replaced it with an Olight 1R EOS and have been happy with the decision.,Extremely bright for its size but incredibly difficult to open the charge port. It would be a 5 star light if it didn‚Äôt take a microsurgeon and dental tools to open the rubber cover recessed deeply into the charge port. That‚Äôs a real bummer for an otherwise awesome product. It‚Äôs somewhat worth the money. But the cover is almost completely destroyed after only 3 recharges due to the picking and prying it takes to open it. Once it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôll be a matter of time before moisture gets into the port and ruins the light.

25,R39HCALRPFOX3N,True,"Great ""Always There"" Necklace Light","I've worn many lights under my shirt since the Blackout of 2003, when a nearly dead Princeton Tec Pulsar light lit up a pitch-black sidewalk NYC that night. Various LRI Photons (including a REX), a Fenix E05, a FourSevens Atom A0, and most recently, a few Nitecore TUBES. And now the Nitecore TINI.

Three nicely spaced levels, from ""middle of the night in hotel room"" low, to ""I know it fell on the floor here, somewhere"" medium, to ""nope, not a bad guy behind that tree, just a shadow"" high. And there's the ""day for night"" turbo, which used to required a double CR123A light just a few years ago.

The light is shelled in lightweight aluminum, which increases durability. The weight penalty is worth it. The bezel, however, is plastic, but worse, it causes light spillback, which is distracting.

The rear-most button turns the light off/on, but it has to be held down for 1/2 seconds before activating the LED. The front-most button cycles thru the three levels. From off, the front button turns on turbo mode, almost instantly--no 1/2 second delay.

There is a last-on-first on mode memory, and no way around this, so you do have to prepare for high when you're expecting low. Normally, the light will turn off after 30 seconds, but this is switchable by holding down both buttons.

This light uses a Cree XP-G2 S3 emitter, which has a nice pure-white tint. It's by no means a high CRI or even a neutral tint emitter, but better than a typical 5mm ""white"" LED.

USB recharging is expected nowadays, and the TINI takes about 2.5 hours to fill up from empty, The little rubber plug is a bit flimsy and will probably fall off one day. The blinking while charging is welcome.

I used it a lot over four days including a weekend, and finally had to recharge it. When the battery voltage drops, first turbo is lost (the blue lights will blink as a reminder), then eventually, high is lost. After that, the light wouldn't turn on, so I don't know if medium and low were lost at some point. I'm satisfied with the runtime.

I mounted the TINI in a Nitecore headlamp strap (the one with different elastic straps to accommodate different positions), and it worked perfectly. There may be other options for mounting this light to other objects, including maybe adding a velcro dot to the large smooth side of the light.

Took off one star for the light spillback, and the 1/2 second delay when turning on.",the united states,"October 18, 2018",Ryan's Dad,4.0,0,2020-11-12 14:22:06.524281,2020-11-12 14:22:06.664721,"Nitecore TINI 380 Lumens USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with Lumen Tactical Charging Cable - Available in 7+ Colors, Aluminum, Copper or Stainless Steel",4.3,53.19,,Tools & Home Improvement,B076QJMK4X,,"#321,393 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The power button needs to be held down for a few seconds to turn the light. A quick press will then turn it off. This helps avoid accidentally turning it on.

The light ships in a demo mode where it shuts off automatically after 30 seconds (to avoid being left on in a store). You hold both buttons to change mode into regular mode so that the light will stay on until turned off.

30,R2SRW4HK31LZ89,True,Disappointing,"After losing my Nitecore TIP, I thought it was a good time to upgrade. The TINI is significantly smaller, and somewhat brighter. As soon as I got the copper version, I was disappointed. The buttons were rattling a little bit, and the shiny metal is actually just paint; it wears off and it is very noticeable. Nevertheless, looks are not a priority. It's a pretty good keychain flashlight, but it is far from perfect, and I'd rather have the bigger TIP model. The TINI has some flaws that are worth noting:

1) It takes a long press to turn on. It takes about two seconds to turn on. On paper, two seconds sound like nothing; in practice, they feel eternal. It is very annoying.

2) It doesn't have a lockout mode. I personally don't mind this, but a) a lot of people do and b) the long press seems to be a safeguard because there is no lockout mode. Having a lockout mode and instant on would satisfy pretty much everybody.

3) It pooped out on me after six months. I didn't use it that much, maybe two to three times a week. I normally use my pocket flashlight because it's easier for me to deploy. Still, it didn't last. I'm not saying they're all the same, but from the beginning, the build quality felt bad and then that happened. I repeat: it's worth noting.

The Nitecore TINI is a good idea, but very poorly executed.

You hear the brand Nitecore and think quality, sorry, not with it one. The entire flashlight has this plasticy cheap design to it that reminds me of something you get as a Tchotchke at those training seminars where they pass stuff out like small solar powered calculators.

For $5 or maybe $10, passable but $nearly $30, no way. The light it puts out is okay, but the low setting is so dim it almost takes away light. The buttons as others have said are far too easy to depress and for something you'll carry in pockets or hang with keys, you'll turn it on and it will be dead.

291,R13YAGU68CI90J,True,"I wanted to love this flashlight, but the interface is BIZARRE (and annoying).","I wanted to love this flashlight. It's absolutely tiny, extremely bright, rechargable (a must for me), with a pretty decent battery especially for the size - all at a great price. They've even gone back to having a dust cap over the charging port which is smart. I have numerous Nitecore flashlights and they keep getting weirder with each new iteration. Unfortunately, the interface on this little guy is bizarre and clumsy - you can't lock it in turbo mode (it's a momentary on / off switch)...you have to press the power button for a full two seconds to turn it on. That might not sound like long, but trust me - in my line of work it is INCREDIBLY annoying. I need to inspect and repair the workings of electrical / mechanical equipment in various lighting conditions all day, every day. I have been wearing keychain flashlights on a lanyard around my neck for many years. I would estimate that I have to turn on a flashlight a minimum of twenty times each day...perhaps more than a hundred on a busy day. The buttons are so close together that I keep accidentally hitting both of them at the same time while trying to turn it on which keeps switching the unit from ""demo"" mode to ""daily"" mode and back again. Because of that, I have to start over with the two-second thing each time. Rinse and repeat. So...Nitecore: um...what's the first thing someone usually does when they pick up a flashlight? Hint: the answer probably has something to do with, i donno, turning the thing on? Why the bizarre two-second delay for using a flashlight's primary function? Make it a .5 second delay AT MOST. Just strange...this is *almost* hands-down the best keychain flashlight in the world...get rid of this silly interface and you'll easily have the crown.
