0,R34A0HSO0S8PEM,True,Great little light!,"Very handy little light!
Does all you need it to do.
Word of caution! The light does have a button lock feature... however, if you have the lock in your pocket, it can easily bypass/unlock this feature and turn itself on... (it will heat up quickly depending on the brightness it's set to... you WILL feel it) ;)
Also, the paint/finish on the item scratches off very easy (had it only a few days on my keyring (with only 1 key on it) and it looks like it's a few months old already.

10,R2ZK4M0827B2AX,True,Zum zweiten Mal gebrauchte Ware?,"Vorweg: Mit den kleineren Modellen von Nitecore war ich bisher ganz zufrieden. Daher sollte es dieses Mal ein teureres Modell für fast 70,- als Geschenk sein. Die erste Lieferung - auch direkt von amazon - musste ich bereits zurückschicken! Da der Karton doch recht verschmutzt und offensichtlich schon geöffnet war. Bei der zweiten Lieferung jetzt sah die Verpackung außen soweit OK aus, also habe ich das als Geschenk überreicht. Jetzt sehe ich nach dem Auspacken, dass das Display total verkratzt ist - s. Bild. Sogar mit einem recht deutlich Kratzer auf der rechten Seite. Laut Anleitung soll außerdem vor dem ersten Gebrauch ""die Schutzfolie"" auf dem OLE-Display entfernt werden. Da war nur leider gar keine Folie, ich war beim Öffnen der Verpackung dabei! Verkauft amazon hier jetzt jedesmal gebrauchte Ware oder Vorführmodelle??? Mir wurde das jedenfalls immer als ""Neu"" verkauft. Das ist extrem ärgerlich bei einem Geschenk, ich muss jetzt erst mal schauen, ob ich das überhaupt (zum zweiten Mal!) umtauschen kann. Nitecore sollte das mal prüfen. Entweder schicken sie selbst schon geöffnete/gebrauchte Ware ins Lager - oder das FBA (Fulfillment by amazon) funktioniert hier absolut nicht. So schnell kaufe ich jedenfalls keine Taschenlampe von Nitecore mehr. Nebenbei: Der Karton bei der teuren Taschenlampe ist ja ganz schick, aber dafür ist die Plastikverpackung dann halt innen drin. Für die Umwelt ist das jetzt auch nicht wirklich besser.

19,R1YX1WOL9ICON2,True,Near Perfect EDC Light,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 So I’ve been looking and collecting flashlights for the past few years (enthusiast but not quite there yet) and ran across this one. I was instantly hooked and let me tell you why.

First off, lets start with the light output itself, since a lot of people, including myself, just look at lumen output and think higher is better. While it is advertised and a max of 1000 lumens, this mode and only be achieved if you hold down the top button, as it will get hot fairly fast, and well a 1000 lumens being a 1000 lumens, you might not that much power for so long. It’s a nice way to safely use it, though I wish there was a way to constantly have it on. The next mode you can use is 200 lumens, which I recently used on night hike clipped on my hat which lit up more than enough at where I was looking. You also have the option to have it on without holding the top button, which is nice. It doesn’t get hot at this limit, and neither at 65, 15 and 1 lumen. I really like the moonlight option, which lets you see things late at night or early in the morning without causing too much of a disturbance, which is helpful for me when I look for things in the dark without waking up my roommate.

The user interface is designed in such a manner that it is easy for anyone that picks it up, and easy to learn and master. Out of the box, the light comes in Demo mode, which automatically shuts off the light after 30 seconds. It’s a nice mode to have if you don’t plan on having the light on constantly, such as checking items periodically, or carry it without having it on lockout mode, which we’ll get to shortly. The second mode which I use all the time, Daily, allows you to use the light with no limitations. Just as the name of the mode explains, it works well if you use it daily. Another great feature is a lockout mode, which basically means you have to press and hold a button to actually use the light. This is great if you use this as your everyday carry and don’t want to worry about the light burning a hole through your back pack or pants. The first lockout mode still allows you to go to turbo mode, which by the way you have to hold the top button to use. The second lockout mode blocks turbo mode and you have to manually unlock it to use. On top of all of this, an OLED screen is available to see what light output you have, voltage, time until the battery dies for every single light mode, lockout modes, and turbo mode. This is pretty unique to the lights ive seen so far, and I do have to say that I really do enjoy this feature on the light.

The build quality and design as overall quite great, but still leaves something to be worked on in future models. The main body is a hard plastic, which does make it lightweight, but I doubt it will survive medium drops, or will become scratched over time. The clip is an incredibly useful little feature, I use it on my hat just about every time I go hiking or at night. The lanyard hook on the rear actually does improve handling it in your hand, since it is quite small to begin with. The size of it is hard to tell from pictures, but it fits nicely in my pocket with no issues whatsoever. The charging port is a micro USB, which in 2018/9 is definitely outdated. Also the cover for the charging port can be easily pulled, which did happen to mine. I wish it was build just a tiddy bit better. The buttons are nice and clicky, but have way too play on them and wiggle a lot, even with a small amount of pressure.

There is certainly much more to work on in the next model, but overall I’m pretty happy for my new EDC light. I would highly recommend this for someone who needs an EDC light, but is looking for something powerful in a really small package.",the united states,"February 13, 2019",Diego S.,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:56:10.312990,2020-11-12 11:56:10.455388,Nitecore Tup 1000 Lumen RCHRGBL Keychain Flashlight Gray,4.4,96.26,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07KPT62P1,,"#72,370 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

20,R11PM80ZLTZ5GM,True,Great idea but fatally flawed,"I'm generally a fan of the Nitecore keychain flashlights like the Tube, Tip, and Tini (I own them all). And this new TUP is a great concept. I love the informative display that indicates battery life and intensity. And the four preprogramed brightness levels are excellent - as is battery life. The build quality is very good too. The user interface is easy to use and understand. The form factor is too big for a keychain and it's awkwardly shaped, but it is small and light and bright and in most respects would make a great EDC light.

But the TUP is fatally flawed with significantly raised control buttons that take extremely low pressure to activate - which means there is no practical way to carry it without frequently activating it by accident. It does have a couple of lockout modes - one that locks out both buttons until you short click then long click the power button, and one that locks out the power button but that lets a long press of the intensity button activate the light at maximum intensity. But the full lockout still lights up the display any time you touch either button. And the other lockout mode is useless because a long press of the intensity button is easy to do by accident.

They need to recess the buttons, and make them significantly harder to press to make this a practical light.

This is a very disappointing product and I would not recommend nd it to anyone until its redesigned.",the united states,"April 30, 2019",J.

On my EC11, I could get rechargeable batteries for it, and when they faded, I would just replace them. Also, I could keep extras with me in my backpack or luggage, and if I needed more light than the battery in it had, it was 30 seconds to replace it and keep going. When this one runs low, you are done. Despite the fancier user interface, I find this one coming on in my pocket a lot more often (yes, I am FULLY familiar with the lock function, it's just a crappy design). With my EC11, if I was afraid it would accidentally turn on, I just twisted the tail cap a turn to prevent it from turning on. When I select the maximum brightness, I'm lucky to get 20 or 30 seconds before it turns off. The EC11 would usually go several minutes at max brightness and then just throttle back to the next lower level. The little screen that tells you what mode you are in is cute, but not really necessary. I'm looking for a replacement. I've got 6 or 8 nitecore flashlights (EA41s, TM06s's) I keep in various places, and have given several away as gifts to my friends (they love the EA41s). This is the first Nitecore I think they missed on.

I've changed my rating on this to 0 stars. Despite using both of the safety lockouts on this, it turned on in my jacket pocket, and melted the front lens. The protective circuit that was supposed to prevent overheating obviously failed miserably.",the united states,"November 19, 2019",GPSIIR,1.0,0,2020-11-12 11:56:12.957095,2020-11-12 11:56:13.097718,Nitecore Tup 1000 Lumen RCHRGBL Keychain Flashlight Gray,4.4,96.26,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07KPT62P1,,"#72,370 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

23,R1MU95JS1ZNMZ7,True,"Great little light, but one flaw","This is an amazing little light that fits in your keychain (although a little bulky compared to the TUP2). The 1000 lumens is nothing short of extraordinary for the size of this light. The chargeable port is fantastic and easily accessible and while using during the more 60 and 200 lumen modes, it holds a pretty good service time.

My one big issue which did cause me to return the item in exchange for a second TUP2 is the power button. While it has a anti-accidental on feature of having to hold the button for 3 seconds to turn on (except for the 1000 lumen bypass), it's not enough to prevent a pocket activation. While 60 to 200 lumen won't be much of an issue, if this thing fires up for an extended time at 1000 lumen it could light your butt on fire (maybe). Either way, it'll drain the battery without you knowing and for when you truly need it.
The TUP 2 however has a guard over the power button, making accidental pressing in your pocket by just sitting incorrectly almost impossible. The TUP 2 while not as bright nor have as long of a battery life, serves as good for a keychain light (700 max lumen).",the united states,"May 3, 2020",The smiley face on Amazon means A to Z -- CRAZY!,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:56:13.101707,2020-11-12 11:56:13.238743,Nitecore Tup 1000 Lumen RCHRGBL Keychain Flashlight Gray,4.4,96.26,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07KPT62P1,,"#72,370 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

24,R212DIVKJX4RFL,True,Cool little light,"I initially bought this because of the shape and the orientation of the 'clip'. I'd planned to build a mount so that I could use it on a machine tool in my shop during a particular operation where I needed more light and can't have any wires in the way. I'm an admitted Nitecore fanboy, and have always been happy with their products and value.

After using it for that particular job, I added it to the pile of stuff I carry around in my pockets all day long. It's light, small, powerful, and works well. The dual-lockout functions are kinda weird and difficult to operate sometimes, as well as the demo/daily modes. Read the manual and practice the button hold sequence before you actually need light. It's not difficult but can be frustrating when your hands are full, you can't see, and can't get the flashlight to turn on because it's locked.

25,R11G72QY53PE95,True,Very nice palm size light with smart screen,"I am a flashlight fan and have too many to list from Surefire and Fenix to NiteCore, Nebo and several others but this one has become a recent favorite with a few minor annoyances. Ok the display and runtime are the best features (and I ended up getting a FENIX UC52 because I love the OLED feature so much!) but some minor issues with the design and ergonomics as other reviewers have mentioned- not able to tail stand, no magnet and the loop needs to be bigger like the Nitecore THUMB which this is replacing due to the THUMB’s short battery life. Having a larger attachment point eliminates the need for the mini biner clip which dangles when its clipped to a hat brim and yes you could put it on top of the hat but the angle is better below. This one beats the TIP2 because of it’s display and a better more robust metal clip but TIP2 might be worth checking out if the magnet feature is important to you. The body shape and size is a bit awkward- too big for a keychain and too squared and thick for a comfortable pocket carry (unless its winter and your wearing a coat with larger pockets). While charging the buttons blink blue and then remains solid and I wonder how much wasted battery drain this causes if charging from a battery pack. Memorizing the lock, lockout 1 and 2 is tedious and frustrating and could be eliminated with recessed buttons. I am a fan of tactical tail cap switches that unfortunately this one also lacks but having a switch for turbo when you need it fast and without fiddling would be a good idea. The power remaining and battery status indicator is really the best thing going for this light. It has a good assortment of brightness levels from very dim to very bright however its max brightness is momentary and you would benefit from using a bigger light than this one if you want pure lumen output and runtime at max. The power port has a slight recess to it if you are using magnetic usb chargers like I do so this is one works well with that slight modification.",the united states,"December 14, 2019",A.

 I use this light multiple times every day for work for the past 5-6 weeks and it's perfect for what I do. I use it to walk down the driveway at night and it lights it up like it's daytime. Never had a functionality issue with it. The battery life is awesome for such a tiny light, on average I use it for two days at a time in between charges. It's so small I've started to carry this flashlight wherever I go. Much better than those cheapo pen lights the EDC people use. My one complaint would be the quality of the finish. It's very prone to scratches and the plastic chrome pieces will lose all its chrome as most of mine is already gone (the chrome on the buttons seem to be holding up much better than the trim pieces).

27,R2OHWXH5HCFHEZ,True,Bright Little Light,"It's a bit big for a Keychain light, but it is an easy light to carry in the coin pocket of your Levi's using its attached metal clip.
I love the gray color of the flashlight with its contrasting silver colored buttons and trim on the sides. The OLED display is covered with a protective film that isn't obvious at first, but needs to be removed. Otherwise, you might think, as I did, that the display is scratched or cloudy.
The display shows your light level, lumens, remaing hours of use on that level, voltage, which mode you are in, etc. The light output and throw is amazing for a light of its size. The tint of the light is neutral for the most part, but on lower brightness levels it may take on a hint of green to the white. The lowest mode is supposed to be 1 lumens, but on mine I would guess it is a bit higher. That might be my only small disappointment with this light.
However, at the other extreme, the Turbo mode seems to be brighter than claimed 1000 lumens, even though the light would get too hot, if you were to use this mode more than intermittently. (In order to protect your hand and this little flashlight, Nitecore only allows an intermittent Turbo).",the united states,"June 21, 2019",wtwieder,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:56:13.632564,2020-11-12 11:56:13.762269,Nitecore Tup 1000 Lumen RCHRGBL Keychain Flashlight Gray,4.4,96.26,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07KPT62P1,,"#72,370 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

28,R2MU2V1Z9669BU,True,Amazing little source of light.,Love this little light and can only think of a few things that I would like to see changed. First would be that I would like to have the turbo setting one of the constant on levels instead of only while holding the mode button. Second thing is I would like like to not have the key ring loop on the bottom because it eliminates the possibility of tail standing the light on a flat surface. Ok one more thing is to have the option to get a tint that is a little more natural white instead of a cool white which is a slightly bluish or even something warmer with a yellowish beam.

29,R3UZ1XZGKZTR0U,True,"Smaller than likely think, cool spin on the flashlight","Product even smaller than expected, though still a tad too large for true keychain carry for me. Given the output, that’s okay with me.

Beam is a nice white temperature and very much a flood, though throw is decent at the higher lumen settings. Turbo, the 1000 lumen level, is bright enough to be used in a defensive capacity or flash at a bad driver during a night walk. It’s the perfect night dog walking/jogging light since it’s so light, bright, and user interface allows for access to the 1000 lumens instantly.

My only issue is the charging port cover. It feels rather flimsy when moved to charge the light, but it does stay in place nicely. It’s still fully intact after three months use, I just anticipate it’ll be the weak point in the long term.

It’s a cool light and brings some different ideas, such as the LCD screen, to the flashlight.
