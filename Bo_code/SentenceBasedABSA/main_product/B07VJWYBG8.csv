0,R1EMQ4POP2727G,True,"1,400 lumens for 2 hours, false and not true - reduces to lower lumen after 15 mins","Just got this in the mail 2 days ago. I was testing the 1,400 lumen stage on both of the lamps to see if it would last 2 hours as the website described. Didnt last 15 mins before the housing got too hot. I think there's a fail switch that if it gets too hot than it has to drop to the lower lumen setting. I'm not sure if this is like for all high lumen head light or if its because the battery is right next to the housing causing it to be too hot. Either way, be aware of the 2 hour setting at 1,400 - not true. Also did it with full battery and same thing. I'm really disappointed, also fenix said they made this particular brand in China. Not impressed! Item was returned due to false advertising. I tried looking at the manual that came with it, nothing in there says that the mechanism in the housing would reset after 15 mins if it gets too hot. I understand it gets hot in there but if your going to mention that you can hold 1,400 lumens at 2 hours than you need to make sure you can do that with the correct housing to handle the heat.

2,R3T2C6C8AWWY5W,True,What Took Me So Long To Buy This,"This is my 3rd Fenix product. Quality & impressive lighting device. I bought the headlamp so i could better my two young German Shepards on the trail at night.

And being in Arizona, regardless of day or night, a trail hazard is going to be rattlesnakes. Week before ordering this new headlamp, i was hiking at night without one of my Fenix lights and me and my dogs walked over what appeared at first glance to be a stick. Turned back to look at it and soon realized we walked over a Desert Night Snake (slightly venomous). It wasn't aggressive and slithered off the trail and into the brush. Trying to prevent incidents like this from happening again with the purchase of this headlamp.

And yes, been out on the trail 2x already using it and love it.

3,R4RVOCWKEZ0ST,True,"Great headlamp, except..","I purchased this headlamp for hunting. Season is not here yet though. I took it out after dark and it seems bright and easy to use. A few days later, I went to test it further and the smaller of the 2 lights is all that would come on. It blinked and was not bright. Off, then on again no change. I removed the battery and reinstalled it, still no change. I reported it to Fenix but did not hear back. That is why my rating is lower. I finally held both on/off switches down hoping to reset something. It worked and the light seems to be OK now. If Fenix FAQs said that could happen, and how to resolve it, I'd be fine.
