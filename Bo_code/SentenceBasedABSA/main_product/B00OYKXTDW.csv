3,RWQJ2D5U6V2LX,True,Great Light with some stiff competition.,"First, let me say that I haven’t had the light long enough to really attest to long-term durability. Likewise, I haven’t tested runtimes, waterproofness or done drop tests.
That out of the way, I really like the 4xAA form factor. I understand the benefits of Li-Ion powered lights, but AA NiMH simply suit my needs and tastes better. There are two basic styles of lights in the 4xAA class that I am aware of: “can” type (such as this light where all four batteries are arranged 1 deep in a circle) and “stick” type (where the batteries are arranged 2 deep in 2 rows).
With the can style, you have a short, round, and fat light. Stick type is longer, flat on the sides (in the battery area anyway), and relatively thin.
As I type this in late November of 2019, I know of 5 4xAA lights from big name manufacturers that are relatively comparable in brightness, price, and quality. Nitecore makes 2 (this light and the EA42; the EA45S can still be found but is discontinued as far as I know), Thrunite makes 1 (TN4A) and Fenix makes 2 (LD41 and LD42). Out of those, all but this light and the TN4A are stick style.

I personally own 3 of them: this light, the Thrunite TN4A (the current or “2015” edition) and the Fenix LD42. All are factory rated between 1000 and 1150 lumens. However, 3rd party testing indicates the Nitecore is only putting out around 760 lumens max, but the other two are both putting out close to factory specs. That’s the one of the two biggest dings against the light. However, don’t count it out of the running completely because of that. 760 is still very bright and you’d be hard pressed to discern the lost lumens unless you had it side by side with one of the others. Even then it is not always readily apparent. For one thing, this light has better throw than the Fenix or Thrunite thanks to a tighter hotspot.
The other ding against the light is the parasitic power drain. Although I don’t recall figures, it is more than the Fenix or Thrunite. And, unlike the Thrunite, it cannot be easily defeated by a short turn of the threads. Again, this may or may not be a major deal for you, but it is something to keep in mind if you plan to store your light unused “at ready” for extended periods. You’ll also not want to do so with alkalines loaded (that’s a recipe for leakage).
So, those two issues cost a star...for me. It may cost it more for you or less. Depends on your priorities for the light.
Now, given that the Fenix LD42 costs $15-$20 more, has a plastic body, and is in the stick configuration; I’ll end the comparison with it here (I do really enjoy that light as well though).
No, the main competitor for this light is the Thrunite TN4A. Which one should you get? Both. Seriously, just get both. You’ll be forever curious otherwise.
Ok, fine. I’ll compare them. As mentioned, the Thrunite is brighter (but not in a really practical amount), has less parasitic drain that can easily be eliminated completely, has better regulation, grips the hand better, is slightly floodier (for better or worse), has a more neutral tint (also for better or worse), and probably has a better overall beam profile (but that is subjective). I also suspect that the Thrunite is a bit better made overall.

Sounds like it won right? Not necessarily. The Nitecore is not as fat (fits my hand better), does not use a battery carrier, has better throw (shines farther), has a 3 stage battery charge indicator (vs the 2 for the Thrunite), and has an arguably better UI (2 button vs 1 - both with shortcuts).

At the time of writing, the price on Amazon for the two is equal. It is a really tough call between the two. I’m very glad to have both. It’s odd, but I think I like the Thrunite more, but I like to USE the Nitecore more. They are both impressive lights and I don’t feel you’ll go wrong with either.",the united states,"November 26, 2019",WRII,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:13:22.414205,2020-11-12 15:13:22.594349,Nitecore EA41 1020 Lumen Cree XM-L2 U2 LED Flashlight Compact Searchlight,4.6,104.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00OYKXTDW,,"#252,882 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

4,R11N5TKGDHXRBM,True,Price to performance is quite good,"Just as a point of reference, I read the reviews on lights like this on Candle Power Forum and where possible, use the review from a guy with a screen name of selfbuilt. His reviews are far more comprehensive than I can make, but for this unit, I believe he is ""spot on"" with his evaluation.

The reason I give it four stars is that the manufacturer seems ""overly enthusiastic"" in their rating of 1020 lumen on turbo. Comparing this one to my Xeno F42 (rated at 715 lumen) this one is just barely brighter on turbo than the F42 is on High. That is not to say it is inferior, just that it seems a tad less than the 1020 rating. Lower than turbo setting seem to be as advertised. :-)

Would I buy another or recommend it to family? In a heart beat. Especially from LUMEN TACTICAL, their price is the best I can find and delivery was on time and as expected.

The only thing to be careful with is the batteries. DO NOT use the Lithium-Ion 14500 rechargable! They are 3.7V output and the batteries in this unit are connected in series. That means the voltage is the total of all four cells.
Standard AA 4x1.5V=6V . . . Lithium-Ions 3.7vx4=14.8v . . . can you say SIZZLE?!
The information in the instructions tells you to NOT use the Lithium-Ion rechargables for that reason.

The pouch that comes with this seems quite reasonable.

5,R3G8RSJCT2JM6E,True,Great light with improved switch cover.,"Great light!! I have literally dozens of LED flashlights, and this is my go-to long range light that gets kept in my Jeep. My wife and I volunteer with dog rescue groups, and we find ourselves searching fields and other areas at night for lost dogs. The fact that this light uses AA batteries is a great choice, as they are common and available everywhere. I also have the Nitecore universal charger to keep a second set of batteries charged up in the Jeep. I've been using it now for over a year and have had zero issues with it.

The prior version of this light had issues with the rubber cover on the switch swelling and melting if the light was left in a hot vehicle., Those issues have been fixed on this newer model. It's built like a tank, and has a great balance of size, features, brightness, and light projection.

Nitecore products were a bit hit-and-miss in past years, but over the last two years their quality of features have really stepped up, and this light reflects that I have a few other Nitecore lights that I'm quite happy with.",the united states,"January 8, 2017",macgyver35,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:13:22.795757,2020-11-12 15:13:23.009293,Nitecore EA41 1020 Lumen Cree XM-L2 U2 LED Flashlight Compact Searchlight,4.6,104.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00OYKXTDW,,"#252,882 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

6,RUR1DRLFO3BWL,True,Yes!! This is the one for me.,"Finally!! A very bright LED flashlight, regular alkaline batteries, on/off switch in the barrel (not the back), and mode memory for all settings. I want to momentarily blind intruders. Most of the super-bright flashlights available today, even the so-called ""tactical"" flashlights, have strange/complex features that simply won't allow this. Some wont remember the brightest setting - how stupid. Having the on/off switch in the tail is another stupid design requiring 2-hand operation or hand gymnastics when the flashlight is used.

7,REL8RNQWXLNS8,True,Incredible flashlight,"I rarely ever write reviews, but I was too excited about this flashlight not to. As an avid outdoorsman, I have owned a million flashlights....this thing is AWESOME! On the highest setting without the beam diffuser attachment, you literally can light things up hundreds of yards away...no joke. It's too heavy for me to take backpacking, but it will be great in the backwoods. You'll never get turned around in the woods at night with this thing. It's seriously like a handheld spotlight. It lights up my backyard like my dual-1,000watt construction spotlights...probably brighter. I feel like you don't even really need the diffuser attachment because the lower power settings make it like a ""normal"" powered flashlight when you're just hanging around camp and what not. The construction feels nice. The on/off power switch, and the switch to cycle through light settings,seem nice....conveniently located on the shaft of the flashlight where your thumb rests, as opposed to the back-end of the light. When you put the batteries in and screw the lid back on, the fitting is super tight, locks into place, and there is zero rattling. It fits nicely in the palm of your hand, and feels as heavy duty as a Maglight. Carrying pouch is decent and nice add-on. I bought this as a gift for my father for when he goes up to our cabin, so I'm very thrilled to give it to him, and I think I'm going to have to buy one for myself now.

8,R2OCC8SPCKVG4,True,This is an awesomely powerful little flashlight! But...one good tip...,"I've had this flashlight for a while now and very happy with it. It is a powerfully little flashlight! It's almost like having a little searchlight in your pocket. Actually, it's a bit too big to be keeping in your pants pocket, better a jacket pocket but non the less very powerful for it's size. I'm very happy with this purchase.
One ""draw back"" is that the power button does not have any raised ""lip"" around it to prevent it from accidentally being turned on while in your pocket or case which has happened to me on several occasions. A couple of times I've had it on the brightest setting which made the flashlight very hot. One time it was in it's holster on my belt and must have been on for sometime and when I finally realized it, the flashlight was too hot to even hold. I had to quickly remove it and put it aside to let it cool down. Since it's already happened several times, I'm sure it'll happen again so what I do now is leave it on the lowest setting. At least this way the flashlight won't become hot and won't drain the battery faster. So I strongly suggest to leave the flashlight on it's lowest setting when not in use just in case it accidentally gets turned on in a pocket or bag.",the united states,"July 24, 2016",Michael B.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:13:23.394810,2020-11-12 15:13:23.595930,Nitecore EA41 1020 Lumen Cree XM-L2 U2 LED Flashlight Compact Searchlight,4.6,104.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00OYKXTDW,,"#252,882 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

11,R1V0N9F0EJ7W07,True,Great flashlight...once you can find the switch.,"A very nice flashlight. Very powerful. Even tho it takes 4 AA batteries, the unit feels quite comfortable to the touch. The addition of the little blue key-chain light is a nice touch. My only complaint would be the the combination off-on switch/mode selector(not illustrated). Once the switch is located, operation is a slam dunk. Problem is...finding the suckka. It seems to be an exercise in 'finding Waldo'....A cruel joke at best! The dark gray switch (on the opposite side) is almost totally hidden on the black body...and is flat as a pancake, as opposed to being sightly raised to be more ergonomically friendly. Notice if you will in the illustration, the relatively easily readable data which proclaims it to be an EA41 Nitecore. And if you are in a darkened environment...Lotsa' Luck. Once finally located, the bottom portion of the switch turns the unit on/off and the top portion of the switch cycles thru the various light stages...not a problem...assuming one can locate the switch. All the manufacture had to do was to have the switch in white (in a manner similar to their product identification BS) and we become as happy as a pig in excrement.
So what is the competition like? I also have a Fenix E41 that is arguably the exact same size...black, takes 4AA's, and seems to have equivalence when it comes to throwing out a hellofa lotta lumen's. It can also stand upright on it's backside (however, with a bit more stability). The single button switch both turns on the unit and cycles thru the various light stages. To turn off, just depress the button and hold it for aprox half a second. AND GUESS WHAT? The black button on the black body is encircled with a chrome outline, making it no big deal to locate.
So which to purchase? If I was to add a THIRD to my stable (after having taken a saliva test), it would probably be the Fenix, but both are excellent units and one would not go terribly wrong with either.

12,R35OJSA6S3ZGV5,True,Its nice and bright but could stand a couple of small improvements.,"A well built light with multiple steps of intensity and strobe function. I didnt give it a 5 star rating because the glass diffuser does not lock the piece of glass into the rubber end cap. Inevitably when you press the end cap over the front and try and get it all the way on it widens the inside of trhe rubber cap and will allow the glass to flop around inside of the cap. If you want silence or just don't want to chance breakage they ought to redesign it to capture the glass better. The switch is pretty small and my mildly diabetic fingertips can have a hard time feeling the small dual function switch in the dark. Its fallen into water a few times now without any problem. The end cap does not prevent the light from rolling off of an angled surface. I wish they made the end cap octagonal. That's it.

Its brightness at maximum setting inside the spotlight looks about the same as 100W incandescent bulb.
Earlier review below ----------
Mine had an obvious problem. At first it simply didn't turn on. I thought I have bad batteries so I put a brand new set of batteries. It didn't turn on. I try another batch - this time it turned on. At that point I got curious and decide to put the previous batch of batteries back. It doesn't turn on. So I put the batch which previously worked - and this time it doesn't turn on!!! At some point I try tapping on it and after a few taps it lits up! This could be a loose circuit problem. So I am returning this one and will try it again. Hopefully the next one will just work and I'll give it as many stars as it deserves.

17,R3V53QLAH3YQ6N,True,One amazing flashlight!,"Definitely my new favorite! Extraordinarily bright on turbo mode (1020 lumens....yep that's not a misprint), great throw distance but the user interface is what really makes this flashlight awesome. With one hand, I can easily switch between modes while keeping the other on a dog's leash, side arm, child's hand...whatever. The direct access to the brightest mode and the dimmest is awesome. I found the micro or moonlight mode (1 lumen) great for reading a map, or even illuminating the trail right in front of me without compromising my night vision. Low (50 lumens) was fine for lighting up the trail a ways ahead of me while conserving battery life, without being blinding. The diffuser that is included is great for giving broad even illumination at closer distances. Great for lighting up a campsite while everyone is trying to get set up after sunset. When I'm not using the diffuser, I put it on the tailcap, that way I always have it with me. I found that during night hikes, I frequently switch between the various modes depending on the situation and this flashlight makes it effortless to do with one hand.

Being powered by 4 AA's makes it a larger flashlight but I think it feels great in the hand, build quality seems excellent.

Using intensity #5 will run down the batteries pretty fast as you would expect, but the nice thing is it will automatically step down to #4 (still very bright) and you get about 80 minutes of use.

20,R1OUCO6DW12FZG,True,Best value in a high end flashlight.,"So I have had one of these little guys for years. I've used it on hog hunts in Texas to light up the night, and it does its job with authority. Recently I needed to order a flashlight for the welder in the shop I work at. They wanted me to get him something good, that wasn't too expensive. The welder told me about this flashlight he has that's supposed to be 3000 Lumens, but only holds 1 18650 battery. I told him thats a no go, and went on Amazon to find this flashlight. It got here the next day, and he brought in his flashlight that supposedly had almost 3 times the power. He shined his on the shop wall, and I put in 4 brand new duracells and shined the nitecore EA41 on the wall next to it. It was no comparison. The nitecore was noticeably brighter. I then shined it over his, and completely drowned his out. This is a true 1000+ Lumen flashlight. Some of those flashlights that go for twice as much but arent name brand and are claiming high lumen numbers are full of crap. Get this flashlight. Or any other nitecore for that matter.

My other flashlights are between 300 and 1200 lumens and this one is somewhere in the range although the difference is fairly negligible - you can't look at any of them.

Use 4 AA Enloop Pro's for best results.,Helped a lot piecing through the rubble of my brother's apartment fire.

Has a good lower setting and then I can ramp it up when cars come or my dog hears something. Great light with the 4 Enloop Pro's I put in there.

59,R2L2PDWULX3Z9C,True,Excellent pocket thrower!,"I was looking for a compact but powerful light with a long throw -- in theatre work I often need to put a lot of light on a small, distant object so I can see what's going on. This light was recommended by someone in a forum and, since the price was quite low, I decided to give it a try.

It arrived as advertised. The light is solidly built. The switches work reliably, and the modes seem well spaced and useful. The ""micro"" mode (1 lumen) is ideal for getting through a dark house or theatre at night without disturbing others. The next two modes are very useful at close range, and the final two modes ... well, let's just say TURBO mode is well named. Outdoor tests at night showed it was able to brilliantly illuminate objects more than 100 meters distant; it would make a fine searchlight! The beam isn't ultra-tight and there's significant spill, but it's tight enough to be very useful at distance.

I have tried the light only with AA Alkaline cells so far; I'll be most interested to see how it does with NiMH batteries since that's what I'll be using in it most of the time. The lockout feature took a while to figure out, but it does work, which is important since there's no mechanical lockout on this light.

65,RBM29OYG1XEAT,True,Plumbers Review,"Hello, I am a plumber and need a good flashlight for just about every service call I do. This is a very powerful flashlight to be sure. But my first problem with the light is the placement of the on/off switch as well as the sensitivity of it. It is very easy to turn on or off. too easy. When putting in the holster it comes with it is a good possibility that you might turn it on. and you cant tell it until it gets so hot you have to check. Also because of the side on/off switch when your getting in to your vehicle and putting on your safety belt the light may turn on by being grazed by the seat belt or pressed into the side of your body. Also and more importantly it completely quit working after about 2 months. It is bright while it lasts but its life is short, but just long enough that you cant return it!

69,RQTFKWCUFD65N,True,"Great Light, Prefer Warmer Color Temperature","I got this light to replace a Fenix TK41 that I gave away. The biggest draw over competitors lights ended up being the integrated battery carrier, dual switch system, output modes, and durability. The only thing I would change about this light is the emitter is too cool for me, I prefer a more neutral color temperature.

A quick note about the kits these lights sometimes come with here on Amazon. Usually they come with free alkaline batteries or little useless keychain lights. This particular bundle I bought featured a garbage keychain light but there was also a nice Olight diffuser....for my Nitecore flashlight. I know sometimes things on flashlights are interchangeable especially lights you can lego, and even amidst different brands, but the diffuser really didn't fit enough to stay on when held upside down.

Ok back to the light. AA powered? check.
Moonlight and super bright Max? check.
Dual switch with great UI especially for rarely used modes? check

The three reasons above are why I chose this light. I have 8 free rechargeable high capacity LSD AA's so I can switch old ones to charge and not lose my light for a few hours, and in a pinch (apocolypse level) I can even throw alkalines in there no problem. Brightness modes are well spaced and useful. Moonlight is not supper super low but they made the effort and frankly I can use it at night without being distracting. On the other end of the spectrum the Max will light up and entire room like the lights are on. The modes in between are spaced well enough, although I love that you can go from off instantly to Max or ML based on which button you hold so much that I generally just use those two modes, but it's nice to know there are more there if I want them. Along the same lines the strobe and beacon are easy to get to by holding down a button depending on if the light is on or off.

Bottom Line I use this light daily and with the exception of the color temperature of the emitter I wouldn't change a thing.",the united states,"July 16, 2015",Jay,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:14:01.363503,2020-11-12 15:14:01.533790,Nitecore EA41 1020 Lumen Cree XM-L2 U2 LED Flashlight Compact Searchlight,4.6,104.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00OYKXTDW,,"#252,882 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

87,R3N0CGQLZG0BO7,True,Great light if you don't carry in pocket or belt.,"Very bright flashlight. Love that it uses the AA batteries instead of the CR123a. Makes it much easier to feed. The only real complaint about this light is the button placement. Due to the size of the light, pocket carry is not very practical. This is not a problem, because of the included holster. Where the problem occurs is the button. With its side placement, it is very easy for it to be hit while in the holster. This has led to me reaching for my light, only to find it on and incredibly hot. Overall I love this light and its like carrying a light bulb around with you. Point it up at a celling and you might as well have hit a light switch. Though like a light bulb after being on (unknowingly) for half an hour it can (if you tried to use it) burn your hand.
