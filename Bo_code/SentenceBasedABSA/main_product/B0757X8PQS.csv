0,R27O0MTK3R8S2F,True,Powerful but not durable and poor ease of use,"Did a bunch of research as was real excited for this product to arrive as I needed a small but powerful torch for general use, hunting and fishing. This item has an odd self-lock feature that makes you twist the battery cap prior to turning on and is not good for emergency use or fast deployment. The power button is oddly placed and hard to operate with gloves on because you can barely feel it. I would opt for a single back button for my future purchases. I also found the levels of lighting to be clumsy to cycle through as the torch must be powered off then on again to go up or down levels other than whatever you last chose and the ultra-bright. Was willing to overlook all of this except for the fact the unit just died without even lasting a year of service. This torch was rarely used and never saw any weather or abuse. It just stopped working. Purchased for use during deer season in Michigan for tacking at night after my last light was too weak. Took it to camp where it died before it could ever be used for its intended purchase. RIP 11/30/2017 - 11/15/2018. I have heard Nitecore products are quality, but this is my first experience with the company. Going to write the company direct to see about replacement and see how well they stand by their products. Should there be no follow up to this post you can assume they did not replace the product. If the product is replaced I will update to let you all know they provided a replacement.

1,RLMEHRO1WXKVC,True,Omygoodness!!!,"I’ve been sporting a $4 ebay flashlight for a couple years. I thought it was a good flashlight. One day my buddy and I were rummaging through a dimly lit building. I was happy as a lark with my flashlight. Then I noticed my buddy’s light. Wow! Full round glow that was much more intense than mine. It lit up the the whole space in which he aimed. It was a Nitecore P12. I immediately had flashlight envy. I’m old school. I thought Mag Lights, with their 4,5, or 6 D cell batteries, were the only flashlights that put out that much light.
I looked through Nitecore’s lights and saw this one. It was similar to his, but without a belt clip. But, it had 1800 lumens!
Pros - perfect light, lanyard, very bright, small.
Cons - (just my opinion) it has a top switch. This means you have to unscrew the battery compartment just slightly to make sure it stays off. If you pocket carry and you forget, your leg will heat up really fast if the button is bumped.
Also, no belt clip.
These are not really cons, just letting you know what you are getting.",the united states,"May 21, 2018",Marc Peters,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:29:56.268251,2020-11-12 15:29:56.390093,"Nitecore EC23 1800 Lumens High Performance LED Flashlight, 1x 3500mAh Rechargeable Battery, Smart Charger and Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer",4.4,194.99,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0757X8PQS,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FpoupcrvL._AC_SX425_.jpg
2,R30HX28OT170NW,True,Well made flashlight,"I'm a professional Aircraft mechanic and flashlights and headlamps are used everyday and night. There are a lot of dark areas that need inspection during the day as well as exterior inspections at night. I have a Nitecore headlamp and really like it so I thought I would try this flashlight. The only thing I didn't like is there is no button on the end, only on the side about an inch from the lens end. That's the only negative I have. The low light mode gives just enough light to see in completely dark areas. The on off button is also the mode button. If you hold down the button it first turns on low mode then switches to high which is very bright. If you just turn on the flashlight then each subsequent pressing increases the brightness. The flash light remembers the last setting you had it turned to which I like instead of having to click through 5 different modes all the time. If the light is already on and you want the strobe feature, 3 quick presses of the button starts the strobe. The battery that came with it is a 3500mah 8A battery. On the brightest setting, the light will last about half an hour. On the lowest setting the manual says 300 plus hours. If you have the light on for a period of time it starts to get hot near the LED end which is normal, just a beware if you are on the brightest setting, I usually use the 3rd or 4th brightest setting. At night if I'm doing exterior inspections I use the brightest setting to get a look at the leading edges of the planes which are anywhere from 20 to 40 feet off the ground and distances of 60 plus feet. I have no problem seeing at these distances with this light. It's advertised at 1800 lumens and based on some other 1000 lumen flashlights I own, I would say that this is in fact 1800 lumen, no over exaggeration like you find on cheaper flashlights. It comes with a ""smart charger"" but I have't used it. I have an Intellicharger that I use on all my rechargeable batteries so I don't know how it will charge, I imaging it will keep temps down when charging so you don't potentially get a thermal runaway which can happen when charging Lithium Ion batteries. It's an electrical thing that can happen, where the temperature rises, resistance goes lower which allows more amperage which builds heat which lowers resistance etc. on and on until you have a melt down. There are other brands that people I know love, it just depends on what you like. If your in the market for a quality flashlight, put this on the list to compare to. I don't think you would be disappointed, I wasn't.",the united states,"July 18, 2020",Monsterbasher1,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:29:56.408481,2020-11-12 15:29:56.544374,"Nitecore EC23 1800 Lumens High Performance LED Flashlight, 1x 3500mAh Rechargeable Battery, Smart Charger and Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer",4.4,194.99,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0757X8PQS,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FpoupcrvL._AC_SX425_.jpg
3,R1TVEMPOBRWSFX,True,Easy to use,"After trying several high lumen flashlights, and returning them...I feel I've settled on this unit. I tried one similar at 2,300 lumens and it got too hot VERY quickly and the next step down in brightness was pretty low. While this does heat up, but not as quickly, the next step down in brightness, suits me fine.

4,R2BHVA2L3CK3Z4,True,"Very bright, compact little light.","Very bright for the size, quite a nice little light. Fits in a pocket nicely. Compact and lightweight. It does get very warm very quick in full power mode.

Only 4 stars because although I do like this light, the on/off switch prevents it being 5 stars in my opinion. A tail switch would have been nicer, but I wouldn't necessarily mind the side switch if it was better. When picking this light up, especially in the dark, it takes a while to find the switch sometimes. It's almost flush with the case of the light and I sometimes roll it in my hand multiple revolutions before I feel it. Especially while you're still getting used to it.

5,R3OT8RAITPAI2T,True,Super bright! Love the rechargeable battery..BUT,"Im glad this came with a rechargable battery because as pleasingly bright as this flashlight is, it eats power quick! Running this on regular batteries would be a waste of money. On its brightest setting it does run a bit hot, but that is expected with this type. I’d definitely buy it again!
Update: its infuriating to keep it in a specified light intensity.. and it turns on & off sporadically. Forget keeping it in your pocket because having the on/off switch on the side makes it easier for it to turn on in your pocket.. the battery life diminishes quickly. Disappointed. This is my 2nd Nitecore and they work great for a few months then fail horribly. Trying to find some warranty repair on their site is useless.

I've had a few times where it activated while I got into my vehicle and didnt notice until I felt the heat scorching my side. I've paired this with a nite eyes expanding holster, works good.

The fix for the accidental activation is to place a good size rubber band next to the switch to keep it from getting bumped in the holster, it also helps with retention..
