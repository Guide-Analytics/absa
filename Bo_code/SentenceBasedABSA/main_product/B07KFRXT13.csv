0,R1U1F93T7K4GYS,True,An excellent little light,"For some reason I can't entirely discern, I have been addicted to collecting little keychain flashlights since the Nitecore Tube made its debut. Since purchasing the first version of that little light, I have since added a Nitecore TIP, a Surefire Sidekick, a Manker LAD, and now this Nitecore TUP to my small collection.

That being said, this light in my opinion most directly competes with the Surefire Sidekick at its price point, and so I will draw many of my comparisons from it.

First and foremost is size. As pictured, it's about the same length as the Sidekick, which is itself about the size of a key fob. The TUP is also narrower than the Sidekick, but with a significant bit more depth, especially around the reflector. Despite the slightly larger size, it doesn't feel overwhelmingly large or heavy in the pocket.

Next is the UX, which I have always had mixed feelings about with regards to Nitecore flashlights, especially the sometimes cumbersome lock mechanism.

In this case, the locking has been made much more intuitive; when turning the light off, hold down the power button for a few seconds after the light goes out and it will lock. From there, simply double press-then-hold the power button, and the light will quickly resume at the intensity it was locked at. In my opinion, this far exceeds the quality of the operational experience of Nitecore's other two-button flashlights.

The OLED display is also nice, providing feedback on the light's status, battery level, estimated run-time remaining, some of which is even rather smoothly animated. It's a bit flicker-y, but not overly bright, and quickly shuts off when not interacted with.

Build quality is mostly good, though lacking in a few areas. The ring for affixing the light to a keychain is quite small, which limits the size of keyring that will fit into it, and overall, it doesn't seem on par with the rest of the light's quality (it's basically a really small keyring kinda shoved into the back of the light), and something closer to the TIP's would be much better.

I originally thought my OLED display was scratched, but it was actually a very thin film applied to the display - the panel itself is pristine.

Lastly, I have provided a picture of the beam patterns of both the Sidekick (left) and TUP (right). Both lights were on their lowest setting (5 lumens for the Sidekick, 1 lumen for the TUP). In general, the TUP's total internal reflection optic has a narrower, more intense spot than the Sidekick's orange-peel reflector, although it is not without spill.

Although both beams actually occupy approximately the same area, the TUP's spill is far less pronounced overall, making it far less evident in the picture. In a side-by-side test, the TUP's beam was more intense at a distance than the Sidekick, despite the TUP being on a slightly lower-intensity setting than the Sidekick.

Overall, the TUP marks a great improvement in UX for Nitecore, and it definitely beats the Sidekick; if you're in the market for a light of this size at this price point, you can't go wrong with it.",the united states,"December 2, 2018",LM,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:49:32.607670,2020-11-12 14:49:32.769152,NITECORE Tup 1000 Lumen Rechargeable EDC Flashlight with Digital Display and LumenTac Charging Cable (Black),4.7,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07KFRXT13,"{'manufacturer': 'NITECORE', 'part number': 'TUP-BK+UCORD', 'product dimensions': '7.01 x 2.95 x 2.95 cm; 53.01 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.

That means that the most you make use of this light is only 20% of its power. The light also gets insanely hot after about 45 seconds on 1000 lumens. This would be a decent product if you could at least lock in a 500 lumen setting and if it had modes like strobe, beacon, momentary etc but there is nothing besides.

3,R3FP6A9PIV9UH1,True,Tired of buying CR123,"I'm tired of buying CR123 batteries for a small powerful pocketable light, and have to either carry a spare or constantly open it up to check the battery level with a multimeter. This is the best micro USB rechargeable option with a clip that lets you use it on a ball cap. It's small size disappears in your pocket, and it seems fair sturdy so far, USB cover seems a little flimsy. The OLED display is very nice to have to see how charged it is. I love lights with a very low output option, and this has a very nice 1 lumen output. Add a strobe mode and this light would be perfect.

2. Controls are easy to use.

5,R31B3PJ1UZJOQF,True,Amazing Amount of Light,"First the positives:
- Battery life. Multiple days worth of light in lower modes. As mine sits at this moment I've got 71 hours at 1 lumen,
18.5 hours at 15 lumens, 9 hours on 65 lumens.
- Size. This little guy is very easy to carry or store compared to other flashlights with this much power
- Lumens. The amount that this light can push out is crazy for the size
- Range of lumens. Not only can it put out 1,000 lumens but the range of 1, 15, 65 and 200 are very handy.
- Screen. The most usable feature of the screen is to let you know how much battery life you have. No more guessing
- Lockout. I wouldn't have thought I would use it but after carrying in my pocket, I turned it on twice. Great feature

Now the Opportunities:
- Key ring. This thing needs to go. This light would be much better if it could tail-stand
- Clip. I wouldn't trust the clip to be able to hold the light to a belt. I know it's probably just meant to hold onto a hat
- Cheap feeling buttons. The light rattles due to these plastic buttons. There's got to be a better material than this.

Now this is nit-picking but it would be nice if they added a clock to the screen. It wouldn't cost much and could come in handy if you already have the light in your hand.

Overall a very nice little light in an incredibly small package. I've had a good time shocking people with the output this little guy has and look forward to a v.2 of this torch.",the united states,"March 18, 2019",PizzaTheHutt,4.0,0,2020-11-12 14:49:33.357767,2020-11-12 14:49:33.522175,NITECORE Tup 1000 Lumen Rechargeable EDC Flashlight with Digital Display and LumenTac Charging Cable (Black),4.7,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07KFRXT13,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bJsfE3FEL._AC_SY355_.jpg
6,R3IJCB74SFNTG8,True,Great EDC Light,"This really is a quality EDC light. NiteCore has always been a decent competitor in the tactical flashlight industry, but it feels like they're really stepping up their game recently. Brightness is great, obviously I can't count the lumens but they sure feel like they're all there. Easy to read and use LED display shows you the output, settings, and battery life.

There's an activation lock to prevent it from firing in your pocket that can be quickly overridden by the 1000 lumen burst feature in an ermergency.

My two gripes with this are that the clip isn't reversible, and that there's a little nub on the buttom for a lanyard preventing me from standing this unit upright. Otherwise, a quality EDC flashlight.

 I've been searching for thee edc mini light/torch and I am happy. I have to learn that because it's small, I can probably lose it. The keychain portion was a pain in the ass, not your normal sized key ring. If you noticed, you have to hold the button for 1000 lumens. But honestly I'm not disappointed (1000lumens will burn toilette paper 🧻) I kinda wish it had some kinda case - when all is said and done...... it's a $70 light and I don't want the display or torch lens to be compromised.

8,R3MFUHCP9BWGYD,True,Handy Little Light,"This is a very useful addition to my keychain. The controls are surprisingly intuitive and the light is easy to operate. Specifically, it is very easy to toggle through various lumen levels for the circumstances. I typically set it to 200 lumens and for a little light like this, that is very bright and effective. In so-called Turbo mode, the 1,000 lumen light cone is very bright--it lights my whole back yard and I have a pretty big backyard.

Only possible negative comment is that when lit in darkness, there is a little light leakage around the 'cowling' at the front of the light, where the parts are joined. (The seam leaks light.) Not a huge problem, granted, but I find it mildly annoying--almost makes the light look cheap. But that's not a major issue and I would still highly recommend the TUP 1,000 (don't like the name either) because of the functionality and simplicity of operation.",the united states,"August 26, 2020",Kdoggrox,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:49:34.031179,2020-11-12 14:49:34.264210,NITECORE Tup 1000 Lumen Rechargeable EDC Flashlight with Digital Display and LumenTac Charging Cable (Black),4.7,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07KFRXT13,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bJsfE3FEL._AC_SY355_.jpg
