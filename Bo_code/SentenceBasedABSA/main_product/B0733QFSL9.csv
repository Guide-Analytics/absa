0,R2C2Q0SR4VO12U,True,Pricey but well worth the investment! My favorite EDC light.,"No joke- I've been researching tactical flashlights for months. There are ridiculously too many from which to choose. I was getting quite frustrated finding the perfect model. So finally after hours upon hours of research I decided upon the Acebeam L16 and I'm quite happy with my choice. Here are the deciding factors:
1. Really is as bright as claims, about twice as bright as your cheap tactical lights.
2. USB rechargeable, therefore I can charge from my car or my portable solar array for charging USB devices while camping. Almost infinite lighting without carrying around spare batteries. Eventually the rechargeable batteries will need replaced but not for years I expect.
3. 5 year warranty. Check closely and you'll notice a lot of high end lights do not have this.",the united states,"January 4, 2018",Heather & Matt,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:36:48.161826,2020-11-12 15:36:48.310939,"Acebeam L16 Cree XHP35 Hi LED Tactical Rechargable Flashlights -2000 Lumens, w/Battery +Andrew & Amanda Keychain Light",4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0733QFSL9,"{'manufacturer': 'Acebeam', 'part number': 'Acebeam-L16', 'manufacturer reference': 'Acebeam-L16', 'is discontinued by manufacturer': 'No', 'material': 'Aluminum', 'power source': 'Battery-powered', 'item package quantity': '1', 'type of bulb': 'LED', 'batteries included?': 'No', 'batteries required?': 'No'}",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410jC4gLqHL._AC_SY355_.jpg
1,RK927J7KH9BDU,True,Itâ€™s perfect!!!,"Hand down the best tactical light on the market. I own several high end lights, Olight, Fenix, Surefire, Imalent etc....

This is a true tactical light. Momentary turbo from the tailcap and full click to remain in Turbo. All we get from the tailcap is turbo and that is what a tactical light is supposed to be.

The throw at 90,000 candela is amazing with exceptional spill. Itâ€™s perfect for all situation when you need to reach out and touch someone and provide sufficient spill.

The light is a home run and I donâ€™t have any personal issue with it whatsoever. Iâ€™d highly recommend it to any law enforcement personal.",the united states,"June 18, 2019",Marylu B.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:36:48.312982,2020-11-12 15:36:48.459745,"Acebeam L16 Cree XHP35 Hi LED Tactical Rechargable Flashlights -2000 Lumens, w/Battery +Andrew & Amanda Keychain Light",4.6,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0733QFSL9,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410jC4gLqHL._AC_SY355_.jpg
2,R24JW4GYNT15UK,True,Best single cell flashlight available!,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I havenâ€™t come across a better all around or brighter single cell battery operated flashlight. Just over 600m of throw, this thing is a little giant. Iâ€™ve bought 3 of these now. I lost one, & bought two more. Acebeam sells accessories separately. Comes with the rechargeable battery and charging cable. Iâ€™ll attach a video to this review. Just buy this one.

5,RYR2QJJ2UUINR,True,Virtually Flawless,"Acebeam thought of everything. I can not find a single flaw with this flashlight.
