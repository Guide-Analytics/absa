5,R1GISMQQJIWC9I,True,Hochwertiger Lampenhalter mit leichten Schwächen im Detail für den Dauereinsatz,"Lieferumfang:
2x Lampehalter
1x Batteriefach, leider nicht für 18650 verwendbar
1x horizontales Spannband
1x vertikales Überkopfspannband

Ich benutze das Kopfband seit über einem Monat jeden Tag auf dem Arbeitsweg und der Baustelle ca. 10-14 Stunden am Tag in Verbindung mit meiner Fenix UC35(etwas über 100g mit 18650er 3500 mAh Accu).

Spannband: 5/5

Alles ist sauber verarbeitet, keine Fransen, lohsen Nähte oder überstehendes Material. Spannung hat sich bisher nicht verändert, was nach über einem Monat ein gutes Zeichen ist. Auch Gipsstaub oder Nässe übersteht das Material ohne Probleme. Stirnband könnte man noch etwas stärker und breiter machen, da es blank auf dem Kopf nach einiger Zeit, zumindest mit einer größeren/schweren Lampe wie ich sie nutze, unangenehm wird. Mit Helm\Basecap, so wie ich es den ganzen Tag verwende und etwas Eingewöhnungszeit kann man ihn ermüdungsfrei den ganzen Tag nutzen.

Halterungen 5/5

Lampenhalter läst sich im Winkel über ein Drehgelenk einstellen. Er arretiert in ca. 15 Grad Schritten und rasted sauber ein. Die Lampe selbst wird mit einer Klammer, welche innen gummiert ist für besseren Halt, gehalten. Schraube, Gewindeeinsatz und Stift auf der Gegenseite sind aus Metall und weisen kein Spiel oder Mangel in der Verarbeitung auf.

Das Spannband\Halterung hält die Lampe sicher am Kopf, auch bei starken Kopfbewegungen, anstoßen des Kopfes an Decken, jeglicher Kopfneigung oder gar Sprüngen aus 3m höhe(vom Gerüst). Auch der eingestellte Neigungswinkel verstellt sich bei keiner dieser Fälle.

Schmutz oder Feuchtigkeit sind auch kein Problem.

Verbessungsvorschlag:
- den Clip zum fixieren der Länge des Spannbandes mit einer Schnalle versehen, welches verstellen des Spannbandes beim ab/aufsetzen(wenn man sich den Schweiß von der Stirn wischt) oder Stößten gegen die Lampe beim arbeiten auf engen Raum verhindert, ansonsten hält der Platikclip das Spannband sicher auf der eingestellten Länge
- einen der beiden Lampenhalter innen gummieren oder mit Schaumstoff für mehr Tragekopfort versehen
- der 2. Lampenhalter im Set sollte eine längere horizontale Schlaufenführung haben und leicht gewölbt sein, um straffer am Helm\Basecap zu sitzen welches gelgendliches wackeln der Lampe bei schnelleren Schwenkbewgungen mit dem Kopf oder Schwingungen des ganzen Körpers beim Kernlochbohren ohne Halterung reduzieren würde
- eine extra Clip ohne Lampen oder Batteriehalter um das Überkopfband zu verbinden, welches sich leider nur in Verbindung mit Batterihalter oder 2. Lampenhalter im Set verwenden läst, was auf engen Raum wie bei arbeiten in Zwischenwänden störend ist

Gewichtsverteilung mit schwerer Lampe ist etwas Gewöhnungssache und sicher störend für Leute die es nur selten und kurz verwenden. Auch die längere Verwendung ohne Helm\Basecap könnte besser sein, da der Lampenhalter nicht innen gummiert/gepolstert ist. Ein straff eingestelltes Band und der Lampenhalter werden nach kurzer Zeit unangenehm durch den Druck auf den Kopf ohne Kopfbedeckung. Alles in allem eine brauchbare Lösung für Leute die nach etwas Suchen auf was man sich blind Verlassen kann wenn man den halben Tag im dunkeln arbeiten muss, robust, solide verarbeitet und gut durchdacht mit leichten Schwächen wenn es darum geht die Lampe gegen Schwingungen des ganzen Körpers besser zu stabilisieren.

Wenn man nach einem Stirnband für den gelgendlichen Einsatz ohne Kopfbedeckung sucht, wird man mit einem besser gepolsterten Produkt sicher glücklicher.",germany,"November 17, 2017",Michael A.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:39:32.613762,2020-11-12 11:39:32.744169,Fenix Flashlight Headband (Fits Lights with 18-22mm Diameter),4.2,36.47,,Tools & Home Improvement,B001NZO85O,,"#143,380 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

7,R3BOBX16ZCWTJ3,True,too much,"Das Headband ist solide verarbeitet und für die Verwendung in anspruchvoller Umgebung sicher nicht verkehrt.
Allerdings ist es mir persönlich einfach zu viel des guten. Die Halterungen für die Lampen sind sehr klobig gestalted und das Teil nimmt sehr viel Platz weg (ist aber sehr leicht). Ich habe es mir bestellt um meine Stirnlampe abzuschaffen und stattdessen meine Fenix ld10 und ld20 auch als Kopflampen zu verwenden. Damit habe ich nur mehr eine Art von Akkus in Verwendung.
Statt der Fenix habe ich mir allerdings das petztl Ersatzstirnband für 5 Euro gekauft und mit schwarzem Gummieband selbst eine halterung gebastelt. Das nimmt kaum Platz weg und ist für meine Zwecke besser geeignet.
Wenn man allerdings etwas für extremere Belastungen wie Klettern sucht dann ist das Headband sicher auch okay. Allerdings finde ich es trotzdem zu klobig. Auch die Batteriebehälter sind unnötig groß und nehmen enorm viel Platz weg. Da kann man sich gleich ne Stirnlampe mitnehmen. Zudem kann man das Headband ja nicht einfach über Kletter- oder Fahrradhelme tragen da die Gefahr besteht dass es wegrutscht.

Daher mein Tip: lieber eine simplere Option wählen und für Helme eine permanente Vorrichtung montieren (wie im Militär üblich)",germany,"April 2, 2015",Alex S.,3.0,0,2020-11-12 11:39:32.881770,2020-11-12 11:39:33.006437,Fenix Flashlight Headband (Fits Lights with 18-22mm Diameter),4.2,36.47,,Tools & Home Improvement,B001NZO85O,,"#143,380 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

12,R3C5D58UTLBUIG,True,Perfect hands free solution. Fenix knows what they're doing.,"This is a fantastic product, and you should buy it. I only knocked off a star because the flashlight clamp is too small for anything wider than a AA battery flashlight, and a lot of flashlights are going in the direction of the CR123s. I jerry rigged mine to fit my Olight S30R, using rubber bands, and it works fine.

With that negative out of the way, here's goes the good stuff. I've always thought that headlamps were goofy. They have to hold an angle, the switches were placed ambiguously, and they really only serve well for me when all I want is a simple flood light. I have five flashlights, and up til now, they were all kind of useless if I wanted to go hands free. This allows me to choose the flashlight with the features I want (LED vs halogen, different color lenses, strobe/1000 lumens/100 lumens/.5 lumens, etc), and it's only $20. I've seen a lot of headlamps go for the same price as a good, rechargeable, tactical light.

Don't think.

13,RQ3SLAABJ6IJE,True,Better then expected!,"I have owned a number of Fenix flashlights over the last few years and Fenix has never let me down. During our last power outage I found myself in our basement holding my EDC Fenix LD12 G2 in my mouth as I tried to remove the screws that held the grate on our floor drain so I could plug the drain as sewer water hid everything from view.

Every time I find myself in a similar situation (holding flashlight in my mouth) I think to myself there has to be a better way!
I have tried a few cheap headband flashlights in the past, but have never been happy with the light output.

This Fenix Headband gives me the option of using a number of different flashlights with it including two of my favorites, the Fenix LD12 G2 and the PD22 G2!

The Fenix Headband I just received from Amazon seems a little different looking then the one they show in their photo so I will try and add a few photos of my own if I can figure out how to.

In the Amazon photo it looks like the knob and the two o-rings on the battery storage container are orange in color.

The knob on mine is black and the two o-rings on my battery storage container are GITD (Glow In The Dark) ones.

It also come with two flashlight mount/clamps as I will show in my photos if I can figure out how to add them to this review.

Also included was two extra GITD o-rings and a extra knob with bolt.

I'm keeping this one in my truck, but I'm considering ordering one to keep in each of our vehicles so I will always have one available.

14,R2LXXSB6JQOULX,True,"Repurposed, it's Awesome","I bought this headband to use with my LD20, and while it does hold the flashlight securely, and does rotate as advertised, I found the complete system was just too heavy. So... to the back of the drawer with you! (It's a quality item, Clark... so I couldn't bring myself to throw it away.)

Some time later (whilst on a fruitless, varmint night-hunt) lamenting the lack of a flashlight on my All-Weather Benjamin Trail NP pellet rifle, it hit me... REPURPOSE THE FENIX HEADBAND CLAMP!

So, I disassembled it, tossing the big rectangular piece and the (until now, hidden) smaller square piece. I broke the two little tabs off, drilled a hole in the side of my stock, and viola!! Tactical pellet gun. Good lookin' too.

I call her the Night Stalker. :)

15,RB2AC455AB0YB,True,Perfect for making your EDC light your headlamp,"Overview: Fits nicely, works great

Pros:
- Comfortable
- Can be used as a single, horizontal headband (or) with the vertical headband for more support
- Comes with two attachments for lights (so you can wear two lights at once?)
- Comes with battery case that has two compartments with seperate lids (perfect for storing one extra battery and some waterproof matches)

Cons:
- Minimal instructions, so there is some playing around to figure everything out

Purchased this to go with my Fenix E12 light. Great combination. What I really love is that the clamp is adjustable so you can fit a Mini-Maglite in it as well. In fact, any flashlight between 18 & 22 mm in diameter will fit, regardless of brand. So it'll work with most smaller lights.

20,R23JJ1APWX9RP8,True,Works great but straps can get out of adjustment,"I have had this for over three years and have used it occasionally since then. If you have a helmet with built in hooks for fitting these sorts of straps -- such as most climbing helmets -- this will fit perfectly and without problems. Some cycling helmets might have these adapters too. If you place this right on your head, you have to get the adjustments just right or it will tend to readjust itself every now and then.

22,R2AH15PDWOMBD4,True,"Outstanding product, but badly needs some instructions!","This headband is great. The bands are extremely durable and hold the unit securely. The light mounts attach easily and securely, and the mount rings hold me Fenix E11 very securely. It's a bit unweildly to adjust the angle of the flashlight once it's on your head, but the fact that you can rotate the angle is a huge plus.

Only downside is there are absolutely no instructions. I'm not even sure how the top band (front-to-back) attaches to the circumference band. Maybe I'm an idiot, but it isn't readily apparent to me. Either way, the circumference band seems to hold the unit in place well enough on its own. This thing is fantastic if you like to wear a ball cap in the field as well. Overall, very pleased.

UPDATE: After doing a bit of research, the top-strap can only be attached if you choose to run at least two of the 3 headband attachments - the unit comes with two light mounts (one for each side, ideally), as well as a battery holder that can attach to the band. I'm only interested in running a single flashlight in the band, and would prefer not to wear the battery pack. So that's a little lame.

27,R11OKT2HX62MKK,True,Better than a headlamp,If you own a Fenix flashlight that will fit with this headband I'm sure you will agree that you have a headlamp system that is superior to any other you can buy on the market. I use this headlamp with my  Fenix PD30R2 6 Level 235 Lumen LED Flashlight PD30R2 flashlight. I bought the headband mostly to use in case I had to put my tent up after the sun went down. I had to do just that this last weekend. The flashlight fits perfectly into the headband. The headband can accomodate two flashlights. The piece that holds the flashlight swivels allowing you to direct the light where you need it. It also comes with a small case that holds spare batteries. Perfect for carrying two extra CR-123As.

28,R1WC0K331MRIR4,True,Makes my Fenix torches even better,"So I've only had this for a few days so far, but my experience with it has been very positive. I have a Fenix LD22 and a LD15. The LD22 is within specs to fit, the LD15 is too small. So first let me say I got this because I didn't really like any of the pure head lamps on the market and I wanted to be able to use my Feinx torches hands free at times. Specifically my tiny LD15. My LD22 fits perfect, nice tight grip, but it does feel a little heavy. Not enough to deter me from using it as needed though. I love being able to easily swivel where the light hits, wonderful feature. The band is also very comfortable, more so than my other pure headlamps. One feature that bugs me a bit though, you can't pre-adjust the band size when off your head. It requires the band to be under tension, so on your head. Once you put it on, it is very quick and easy to adjust though, either making it tighter or looser as needed, and I haven't had any issues with it loosening on its own yet. So for those of you with smaller lights like my LD15, I have a work around. I just cut a small piece of a grippy jar opener and wrapped it around my LD15. It is grippy on both sides, so no issues with it coming out, and just enough extra diameter to be a very snug fit. It has worked perfect. The LD15 does get very hot when using on high mode normally, so I don't know if having it in a confined space like this will make any difference, but we'll see. I might have to get an extra LD15, have one on low mode pointing down, one on high mode pointing away. Wonderful possibilities!",the united states,"April 22, 2012",J.

I put some medium locktite on the threads and solved the problem. I added a a piece of felt material as a cushion for the back side of the light for more comfort.

*** Update 8/2013 ***

In light (heh..) of recent developments and new products, I would not necessarily choose this over a dedicated quality headlamp.

Comfort.........great
workmanship.....great

It works....the only thing is I wish when people put directions in a box they were actually functional. This product rocks and you can figure it out easy enough. Very comfortable and the ratcheting adjuster for the height of the light works great. I personally use lithium energizer batteries and the fit in the battery holder perfect and are very light. every thing works like it should. One other note if you are going to use this for a different light then a Fenix make sure you have the correct thickness of barrel to slide into the holder. If it is too fat it wont fit.

47,R27ASKBWO8MFI7,True,How to use a light with a bigger diameter.,"Mine was delivered yesterday and none of my lights that use an 18650 battery or 2-123A lithium batteries would fit, until now. I placed my Zebra Light SC600 in the holder with the hinge facing down and removed the hold down screw. I then inserted a 8 inch long wire tie, Amazon sells them, search electrical cable ties, through the hole that the mounting screw normally is inserted. Then I continued placing the wire tie through the other openings in the bracket until I put the end of the wire tie into it's own end, which secures it. Wire ties/cable ties come in handy for many uses. Any hardware store or electrical supply store has them. If they are too short, just connect 2 or more together and cut the excess off. If you want to remove the light you will need to cut the wire tie off and put a new one on. Just about any 1 inch diameter or slightly bigger flashlight will fit with this method. I emailed Fenix for a recommendation for a 18650 flashlight to use and they responded with this: ""If you want to use 18650 battery, the best light for you will be Fenix PD35 - http://www.fenixtactical.com/fenix-pd35.html

51,R2VN9YY4JV742Q,True,Fenix Headband for 18-22mm Flashlights Review,"I'm an enthusiast about flashlights and coolers. This includes an interest in headlamps. This is a review of the Fenix Headband for 18-22mm Flashlights. I try to explain in detail what qualities I take into consideration so readers can understand my reasoning behind the rating I give. However, if you want the short of it, skip to the conclusion.

There are several things that I look for when considering a flashlight. 1) Only flashlights that use AA or AAA batteries are considered. Those two batteries are the cheapest and most readily available batteries. Plus, in an emergency, I do not want to be scrambling for different types of batteries (C, D, 9V, CR123, or any other type of specialized battery). 2) The design has to be shock resistant and waterproof. 3) The longest battery life in proportion to the output. I would like an efficient flashlight. 4) Best combination of durability in ratio to size and weight. I look for the lightest and most compact lights that are durable, which is extremely important in headlamps.

I found that the Fenix LD20 met those standards exceptionally well and rated the flashlight a 5.0 out of 5.0 in a previous review. I soon began looking for a headlamp that had similar power.

The best headlamp I have is the Princeton Tec EOS, which was purchased over three years ago and has a maximum output of 50 lumens. I spent hours online and at the store to compare all the different headlamps for the best in consideration to durability, lightweight, batteries, output, efficiency, and comfort. When I purchased the Fenix LD20 earlier this year, the output easily outshone the other lights. Ever since then, I have been in search for headlamps that utilizes the CREE LED technology. Unfortunately, the headlamps with using CREE LED technology and having output close to 180 lumens took four AA batteries or specialized lithium cells. Either way, this left me with either a heavy set up or having to add specialized batteries to my stock of AA and AAA's. Fortunately, I found the Fenix Headband that utilizes my favorite flashlight, the Fenix LD20.

Positives: 1) The headband is as comfortable as the headband of the Princeton Tec EOS, which I considered to be the most comfortable band in my experience. The Fenix Headband can be set up with just the single, circular band around the head or with a second band connected to go over the top of the head. It was more comfortable for me to use just the single band around the head. 2) The Fenix Headband is fully adjustable. You can adjust the size around the head easily, the second band over the head, the position of the light mounts, and the position of the battery pack. 3) It comes with two flashlight mounts and a waterproof battery pack. The mounts have a rubberized interior so it can grip flashlights securely with out slips or scratches, and can rotate 360 degrees so light can be angled in any direction with distinct and locking incremental clicks. This also means you can set up a flashlight on each side of your head with different angles and directions for each light. 4) Everything appears to be of excellent quality. 5) When using the LD20, the Fenix Headband makes an extremely powerful and efficient headlamp.

Negatives: 1) One picky thing is that the Fenix Headband when set up with the LD20 is heavier than the Princeton Tec EOS. However, the power and efficiency of the LD20's output far outweighs the amount of weight added. If the Fenix Headband were any less comfortable, this would be a significant issue. I remain hopeful that Fenix will focus on a lightweight headlamp that uses the powerful and efficient CREE technology.

Conclusion: Overall, the Fenix Headband is a fully adjustable high quality accessory with excellent build quality, top-level comfort, and allows flashlights such as the Fenix LD20 (with a diameter of 18-22mm) to be used hands-free in the form of a headlamp. I would rate the Fenix Headband a 5.0 out of 5.0. My only wish is that the set-up could be more lightweight. However, this is not a problem of the Fenix Headband, but a result of using regular flashlights as headlamps.",the united states,"November 12, 2009",G.

52,R3DZNC74Z1AEC9,True,I'm even more impressed with Fenix,"I never write reviews but I have to give credit where credit is due. Fenix is a great company that builds quality products. I bought the LD-20 a few months ago and it's by far the best flashlight I've ever purchased. It shines like a spotlight, takes two AA batteries, is small enough to easily fit in your hand, yet is solid enough to feel strong and durable. I just got my headband in the mail today and tried it out. First of all I was impressed with everything that came in the box that was not included in the description. It comes with two headbands. One is normal sized while the other is about half that size and can fit around your forearm/leg/wrist/whatever. It comes with two mounting clips. It comes with a battery mounting clip with two capsules on it that carries two backup AA batteries (has watertight seals on it). It also comes with additional screws and o-rings. That was much more than I was expecting. Aside from all the extras they give you, the headband works great. It's as comfortable as just about any headlight. The clip that mounts your flashlight has a knurled surface so your flashlight wont move around at all, actually, you barely have to tighten it to make the flashlight immovable. The clip can rotate 360 degrees. My LD-20 fits perfectly. It's comfortable and is super handy.

TL;DR - Fenix is a damn good company that makes quality products. There are tons of extras with this headband and I'm very impressed. Never have I been disappointed with this company or its products.",the united states,"July 25, 2012",adamb,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:39:56.562209,2020-11-12 11:39:56.685313,Fenix Flashlight Headband (Fits Lights with 18-22mm Diameter),4.2,36.47,,Tools & Home Improvement,B001NZO85O,,"#143,380 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

73,R2QW463YMU1TBR,True,Totally Customizable To Your Specific Needs,"I totally geek out on cameras, knives, and yes flashlights/headlamps. So my purchase was more to have all the accessories to my Fenix LD20 flashlights, than a neccessity.

My plan was to continue using my dedicated headlamps that I've collected from all the big brands (i.e.,Fenix 7, Black Diamond Icon, Petzl E87,etc,). However, this headband with two Fenix LD20 flashlights, and two Eneloop AA batteries in the battery holder has proven to be a far more versatile lighting system than I ever imagined.

It's great that you can use your favorite brand flashlight, that probably is far more powerful than a dedicated headlamp. And as flashlight technology improves, you can use that new flashlight in your headband.

You can set the headband up with just the band that goes around your head or use with the secondary band which goes over the top of your head. I use both bands and it's very comfortable, and I don't really like things on my head like this. It's also very secure with the second band.

It comes with two flashlight mounts and a waterproof battery holder that makes this headband VERY CUMSTOMIZABLE! You can use just one flashlight. A flashlight and the battery holder. Two flashlights and a battery holder. However you like.

They have rubber linings inside the mounts that grip your flashlight/s and has knobs for screwing down to the exact size of your flashlight (18-22mm). It hold very securely with no worrys about slips or scratches.

You can can rotate the mounts 360 degrees to shine the light at any angle and it clicks firmly into place. So you can aim your lights at different angles.

105,R1D0O9OI27KYY4,True,I cannot recommend this headband for use with the LD20/22,"I cannot recommend this headband for use with the LD20/22. I'm not saying the headband itself is bad, but I'll explain.

For use with the Fenix LD line it has the perfect setup, decently long clamp to (in theory) balance the flashlight, and extra batteries right there if you ever happen to need them. Sounds great right? Well not so much

1. The LD's don't have a great balance in the first place, it's pretty rear heavy, and you may find yourself illuminating the night sky without constant adjustment. Yes, technically, you can mount it, but the flashlight's length and weight prevent it from being practical.,

2. The extra battery compartments are ridiculous looking, noisy, not easily accessed, and heavy!! The instant I put the whole rig on I felt foolish. The battery tubes are much too large for the AA batteries the LD20-22 requires, and any movement leaves a clacking noise on your temple (original mounting point). I felt like I had strapped an overweight maraca to the side of my head.

3. You don't need it! The most basic headlamps are going to take care of all of your dusk to dawn outdoor needs! Your eyes adjust to the light around you. Plus everyone you're camping with will hate you when you look at them...

Conclusion- nobody mounts high powered flashlights to their head unless they're mining or spelunking. You'll be fine with a cheapo head-mount for getting around the terrain, and a good pocket flashlight like this ---> Fenix Flashlights LD22 2015 Edition 300 Lumen LED Flashlight",the united states,"July 11, 2016",Amazon Customer,2.0,0,2020-11-12 11:40:20.208634,2020-11-12 11:40:20.336862,Fenix Flashlight Headband (Fits Lights with 18-22mm Diameter),4.2,36.47,,Tools & Home Improvement,B001NZO85O,,"#143,380 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

136,R1VWY78OTSH347,True,Overpriced,"I have used several different headbands, both recreationaly and occupationaly.

Cons:

This headband is the worst for holding adjjusted size. I judge a headband on how easy it is to adjust from a helmet to bare head and hold that adjustment during use. This headband easily slips.

It is overpriced. It is worth maybe 8 dollars in comparison to other headbands on the market.

The second mount is unecessary and should be sold as an accessory to lower the price.

Pros:

The most adjustable of the headbands that I have used. The side mount is very well engineered.",the united states,"February 8, 2012",Duane L.

137,R21HMUOQCLZUEA,True,Nice mounting bracket on a useless piece of elastic,"There are two parts to this product: the mounting bracket and the headband. The bracket works fine, and does exactly what it should. It's a bit bulky on the side of your head, but a functional product. The elastic band for around your head, on which they expect you affix said bracket, however, is terrible and completely useless. It lacks a necessary plastic buckle to secure it, thus making it impossible to adjust or tighten the band.
