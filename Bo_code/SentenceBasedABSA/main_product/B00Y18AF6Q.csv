0,RX9W1H7DLQ6FN,True,Good light. Exceptional seller.,"I normally only write reviews if there is something amazing or something really disappointing. I mean, our expectations are that things are going to be ok, right? So..... This is a good concept and a good light. I’d like a little more throw, I think, but everything’s a compromise. The thing I really want to mention is the sellers’s customer service: some months after purchase my light developed a problem.

1,R3G9S5F1LMP01D,True,Love it!,"I EDC this light. Love it. No negatives. I was using a small Olight previously, however the tiny and overly thin pocket clip snapped in half in my pocket. I looked at other lights and decided to ""upgrade"" to this one. Upon receipt, I was happy to see the pocket clip is nice and thick. It also feels ""springy"" so I don't think it would ""snap"" as easily. My first impression was good. The light feels solid and well made.

The light is very bright. In fact I have only used this light above the 5 lumen setting 2 times. Typically I keep it on the lowest setting and have plenty of light for my needs in my immediate vicinity. If I need a bit more light to see something a bit further away I just tap through the brightness levels and keep tapping until it cycles back to the start. It works well and is very convenient. I have never, nor do I plan to use the strobe, but I'm glad the light is feature complete.

The battery lasts me quite a long time. With regular nightly use I have charged it only 2 times in the time I have owned it, about 3 months now. I have to confess that I charged it most recently ""just in case"" it didn't flash that it needed a charge but I wanted to ensure it would not run out at some random time. I honestly don't know how many months I could go between charges. Safe to say, for reasonable every night use you could charge 1 time per month and be assured that your light will be ready when you need it. I'd rather charge too frequently and buy a new battery sooner, rather than go without my light in a time of need.

I'm happy with this light and expect years of service. Great light.

2,R80STSYR1IGI4,True,Turbo is a phantom,"I can't get it to remember or switch to Turbo mode, the highest brightness for more than a few seconds. I understand it has a thermal switch that is supposed to automatically kick down from ""turbo"" to ""high"" after 5 minutes, but I haven't even been using it and it's not hot. It's been sitting turned off for an hour, I pull it out and it won't remember turbo. So I scroll through to get turbo which lights up for a few seconds and then switches to high.

As a tactical light, if this isn't turbo on-demand, it's useless. The high mode just isn't bright enough.

For everyday use, I only care for the low setting. What I don't like is I can't select the level until after I turn it on. So I have to turn it on in a mode I don't want and then scroll through several levels I also don't want and to get to the level I do want.",the united states,"March 24, 2019",Westerner,2.0,0,2020-11-12 11:21:59.991108,2020-11-12 11:22:00.139711,Fenix PD25 550 Lumens CREE XP-L LED Pocket Flashlight with Fenix Rechargeable Battery (Built-In USB Charging Port) and LumenTac Charging Cable,4.7,132.81,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00Y18AF6Q,,"#449,252 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

4,RW653OUQ0648N,True,Perfect,"Update.. 09/18/2020 Though not really an update this is just one gripe that I failed to mention in previous review. I wish this little guy had a two way pocket clip..

5,R1G504YPF51HN4,True,Great light for EDC,"I bought the PD35 for the home and the PD25 for EDC, and I'm supremely pleased with both. I wanted a durable light with useful settings, easy operation, and that I wouldn't even feel in my pocket. The PD25 is all of that. There's a single, large button on the back which provides on and temporary-on capability. The button on the side does not turn the light on (so it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket!), but rather, when the light is on, switches through a few brightness settings. When the side-button is held, it activates a rapid strobe. Best of all, again, I don't even feel it in my pocket. I clip it in place, so it's there when I need it, and out of the way when I don't.

Battery life is excellent and this little guy produces some serious light. It has three settings with the brightest being 550 Lumens.
It takes about 2.5 hours to totally recharge the battery.
My wife carries one in her purse. She goes into work twice a week to a big city and during the winter months walks to her car in the evening when it is dark. She loves having it with her should she need the light.
