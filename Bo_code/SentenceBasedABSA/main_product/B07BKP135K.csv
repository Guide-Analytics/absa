0,R3US1AKFZDL6FN,True,"One of the best, but could be better","I like the build of this flashlight, very strong and fits in your pocket. 500 lumens max is pretty bright in a small package. I do not like the user interface; the .5 sec hold to turn it on and off is quite annoying. If it's to prevent it from turning on in your pocket, fine, although there's mechanical lockout for that. Holding it to turn it off irritates me. I wish there was a ramp up option where you just hold the button and it would cycle through the modes. I did not see an easy way to remove the clip. While useful, if put in your pocket, it can get caught and then bends and doesn't stay clipped as well. The top oring with usb cover gets caught and slips off and I'm constantly pushing it back into place. That being said, I like the color of the light, I've dropped it on concrete several times and it hasn't broken, it's magnetic and doesn't short out like the ones with magnetic charging, and the battery has a very good life to it.

1,R1I6N5H0MWX9ZS,True,A hands free light.,"This is my first 90 degree angle6-8 d light. I have been collecting flashlights for over 20 years now. It is very cool to be able to clip this light to the front of my shirt or coat outdoors at night. This Fenix LD15R is IP68 rated. For those out there that do not know that means it is dustproof, able to withstand being dropped from about 3 feet without damaging the electronics and waterproof up to about 6 feet of water. In other words this light is made to very tight tolerances and should be able to last you a very long time. The only thing I do not like about it is the user interface or UI. This light also has a red LED as well as an SOS function. The button on the top of the light could be better. The tactile feel is to soft. I keep winding up passing over whatever function I want it to do. Still, it is a right angle light that is IP68 rated.",the united states,"May 26, 2018",Amazon Customer,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:32:03.433522,2020-11-12 11:32:03.569209,Fenix LD15R 500 Lumen Right-Angle White & Red LED Rechargeable Mini Flashlight w/2 x 16340 batteries & LumenTac Battery Organizer,4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07BKP135K,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pzsis7cYL._AC_SX425_.jpg
2,RJCG3FGM1LZND,True,Critical fail.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I like the output of this light but have some issues.

First being, anytime I use the magnetic tailcap to adhere the light to a surface, it either momentarily shuts off or completely goes out and I have to unscrew it, and screw the cap back on before it will turn back on.

Second is you cannot directly access the red light. Before you switch to redlight, you have to endure a quick flash of white which can ruin your night vision.

Third is the momentary hold of the light switch to turn it on/off. .4 seconds can seem like eternity when you need light ASAP. Same for turning off.

Forth, the clip is springy but the metal is thin and seems cheap compared to the rest of the light.

This light may be good for a maintence worker or mayne a camper, but it's not for tactical/surrupticious operations.

But, the output is nice, I like that it recharges and the body seems durable.

I usually run a Streamlight ProTac1 for EDC and will end up returning this one.",the united states,"March 18, 2020",OutdoorGuy,1.0,0,2020-11-12 11:32:03.574195,2020-11-12 11:32:03.705527,Fenix LD15R 500 Lumen Right-Angle White & Red LED Rechargeable Mini Flashlight w/2 x 16340 batteries & LumenTac Battery Organizer,4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07BKP135K,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pzsis7cYL._AC_SX425_.jpg
3,R3QNMLJFKQLRUS,True,"Unusably bendy pocket clip, not for Everyday Carry","Before I absolutely rip on this flashlight, I'd like to point out some things I liked. Yes, it puts out a fairly decent amount of lumens for its small form factor. It does have an extremely handy magnetic base. The usb jack on the top saves me the extra 15 or so bucks of buying a 16340 charger. aiite cool whatev, these pro's hardly outweigh the cons.

First of all, the redlight is waaayyy to bright to sustain night vision. A redlight flashlight should be almost inperceptable in daylight. 1 lumen is more than enough. You'd be better off buying a dollar store button-battery keychain light with a tiny red LED on the end than trying to use this flashlight where it matters most.

Secondly, and most importantly, the pocket clip is made of extremely soft stainless steel instead of low carbon spring steel! This was the killer for me. After less than a week after I bought it, the pocket clip had distended and become unusable (pic included). I'd far prefer the pocket clip to rip out the linoleum off the table I caught it on than bend out and lose its usefulness.

Either way, the seller was quick to deliver, and the fault is on the manufacturer anyways, but for gods sake, don't buy this flashlight if you're looking for something that's gonna last.",the united states,"May 28, 2020",U.N.

Worked well taped to the front of my helmet for pitstops, driver changes and working on the car. The rechargeable batteries are great, but you can also use normal disposable CR123.
