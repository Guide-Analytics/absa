6,R12IP8HCMNMV6G,True,"good quality light, with some design issues","I have had the light for well over a month now and I carry it and use it everyday. Here is what I have found about the light based on my experiences with it.

Pros
-long battery life
-super bright highest mode and adequately bright second highest mode. also the lowest mode is very useful in it's own way. the four brightness modes they give you pretty much cover all bases. lowest is good for reading and not ruining night vision. next highest is good for having a long lasting light for general activity in the dark like splitting kindling or setting up a campfire. the second highest is a good brightness for looking for things in wide open areas. and the highest brightness is just shockingly bright, which every good flashlight needs.
-two operating buttons means a more intuitive UI than a single button
-super thin diameter means it will comfortably fit in your pocket all day long. it is great for EDC because of this.
-the strobe mode is a real strobe mode. not like the kind on cheaper tactical lights where it fades in and out. this strobe mode turns on and cuts off instantly, many many times per second.
-extremely drop resistant. i dropped mine about from about 11 feet in the air onto a wooden floor and it was fine.
-extremely waterproof. i use it in the rain all the time and have used it under water without issues. submersing it is also a convenient way to cool it down quickly.

Cons
-heats up very quickly on brightest mode. this is to be expected because of the high power and small size, meaning poor heat displacement. but if it heats up too much you can just dip it in water to cool it down quickly!
-MicroUSB port plug always pops out when light is in pocket. I had to tape mine shut. this could easily affect the waterproof rating and those of us with separate 18650 chargers don't even need it. I am thinking of filling it with RTV silicone permanently to fix this annoying and potentially damaging problem.
-in the dark it is hard to find the mode side switch. it feels just like the microUSB port plug and is exactly 180 degrees offset from it, so sometimes you will accidentally press the rubber microusb plug.
- steel spring clip pops off too easily. it won't come off in your pocket but it would be nice for it to not come off it you grab it wrong

overall it is a great light and I am satisfied with my purchase but for the price I paid I think nitecore needs to address the issues. the best simplest fix would be to remove the microUSB charger completely, or at the very least make it stay in better.",the united states,"April 27, 2019",Toolman,4.0,0,2020-11-12 14:19:47.539928,2020-11-12 14:19:47.782848,"NiteCore MH12 USB Rechargeable Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 1000 Lumens 253 Yard Beam Distance 520 Hours Runtime Portable Tactical Flashlight Waterproof Compact Searchlight With NL188 3200mAh 18650 Battery, Black",4.1,132.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00T7693IS,,"#142,047 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

8,R1UYTTC5UO7QOW,True,Pricy but it delivers as advertised.,"Awesome flashlight!

I have owned a Nitecore brand flashlight before (MT26) which was very similar to this flashlight but a little cheaper with fewer features.

The USB charging port and separate ""mode"" button make this a great flashlight.

I have given this flashlight a full five stars in spite of the fact that recharging the flashlight requires you to plug in the flashlight and THEN turn it on. That was a little frustrating to figure out the first time but it does say that in the instruction manual so to be fair, my frustration was entirely my fault.

This is the brightest flashlight I own. I can use this to light up my entire living room during a blackout as well as see down into a deep hole in the middle of the day... if you have ever tried to look down into a manhole in the middle of a summer day, you know how awesome this is.

There is only one drawback to this flashlight... on high... it gets HOT! don't leave it on and put it back in your pocket. I didn't lose any skin but it sure was embarrassing when you realize what's ""biting"" you is your flashlight.

10,R30RAMIK8E8GXG,True,Today I went to a campground with my friends to have some fun and I was using this flashlight,"I bought this flashlight 1 month ago and did not have a chance to play with this puppy so far. Today I went to a campground with my friends to have some fun and I was using this flashlight. The performance was better then I expected. This poppy can stay on a high beam for more then 1 hour with no problem on ambient temp of 42F with no overheating. I have a lot of flashlights in my collections, including StreamlightProTech-HL. But this one is better and cheaper.
Steamlight is out of power in 20 mins on standard batteries, on top of this the generated heat is very high.
This one have some heat dissipation but is not much compare to Sreamlight. The power of light was great. I am not sure about 1000 lumens claimed by manufacturer but I could see object as far as 150 yards away. Good product and good quality.

May 6, 2015 update. I am very pleased with this flashlight. I just installed this poppy on my AR-15 S@W .223 using AccuShot Premium 1-Inch Weaver Style See-Thru High-Pro Rings replacing my Streamlight (the Streamlight is the great product but battery life should be better). Fits perfect and it has no problem with recoil so far after about 1000 rounds. I am worry about rubber covers on the charge and mode ports but I have not been under the rain with this flashlight so far. Place mode button on the top if you are planning to install this flashlight on your gun and play a little with it to become comfortable changing the mode in complete dark.
Good product. I am planning to get another one for everyday hands on use. The first one went to my AR-15 as you know and I love this gun.

18,R2ZXSNUL755UP7,True,Buy this.,"Im gonna break away from the nice review talk and be real here.

This flashlight kicksa**. I bought it before a month and a half long camping trip through the western US. I charged it to as full as the display would go, ( 4.5 blinks) and used it a F**kton. Nearly every night, at the almost brightest setting. Writing this now its down to 3.5 blinks, I haven't charged it yet, its been a two months since charging.

The 1000L strobe is amazing, it will send wildlife and any people you dont want near you away very quickly, trust me I've tried it on friends, family, deer, skunks, and the occasional drunk redneck at a campsite. Its powerful enough it hurts.

The 0.5L setting is amazing when its seriously dark out and you dont want to blind yourself, also when you wake up.

Its sturdy construction, I feel like I can pack this in a fist and really hit a guy if I have too, or just hit him with the tail cap.

28,RSYYYJWMK0GID,True,"Bright, but unreliable.","So after a few months of use I have to say this is a very bright light, with what seems like decent battery life. However this light gets 2 stars because of sub-par build quality. About 1/2 the time you will press the on button and the light wont turn on. It requires knocking the head in the palm of your hand to get it to turn on and it will flicker like its making poor contact with the battery until it finally turns on properly. I work as an EMT and my light being reliable is sometimes literally life or death. This product has been built poorly, and at this price point, I would not expect this type of spotty reliability. No damage has occurred to this light, all the caps are tight, and this problem started about 2 weeks after receiving it, though it only recently started to get really bad. Today I finally had to put it away because it failed me in the middle of a call and ended up causing a big problem.
