0,R38WPUSG48P31O,True,Fantastic headlamp,"This was a replacement for my Lenser H7 which in itself is a pretty decent light, but it's NOT this light. As in not even in the same ballpark.The HC60 has the usual Nitecore build quality, machined billet etc. Yes, the cap has to be removed for micro-USB charging, but it's not like you're going to be wearing the light while it's connected either, so leave the cap next to it while it charges. I used my Nitecore Smart charger anyway as it's five times faster. I can see the USB will be handy for topping off between caves or campsites though. I'm a communications tech, and often do wiring in TELCO rooms or other dark places, and I really like the natural light this one has. If I need to ID a slate/red wire in a phone trunk cable, there's no second guessing with its natural daylight output. Most LED's including the H7 it replaced has a bluish cast. The beam has enough side spill that working on wiring from a couple feet away is easy, yet on turbo will light fully up something 300 feet away.

UPDATE 2/28/2017: As soon as a workmate saw it, he'd ordered himself one. It didn't specify, so it's the normal LED output. It's not obvious until you get them side by side, but the natural light that I have is much closer to daylight, while his looks bluish. We compared the two against each other while looking at TELCO 25 pair cable in a dark room. The natural is quite a bit better at seeing the correct wire colors. With the non-natural, it's harder to distinguish certain colors, especially in the yellow and red end of the spectrum. With his, it's harder to tell light yellow from beige where it's very obvious with my light. Something to consider when buying one. His however, does seem a bit brighter lighting up things at the far end of our 60 foot long install bay, but that's a comparison. With either one alone, things that far away on 1,000 lumen mode is pretty much lit up like high noon outside.",the united states,"February 15, 2017",Craig U.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:15:30.498876,2020-11-12 15:15:30.743354,"Nitecore HC60 1000 Lumen USB Rechargeable LED Headlamp, 3400 mAh 18650 Included Plus LumenTac Car & AC USB Adapters",4.6,136.42,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01JGYRBA2,"{'product dimensions': '5.08 x 19.05 x 25.4 cm; 226.8 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.', 'item model number': 'HC60', 'is discontinued by manufacturer': 'No', 'color': 'BLACK', 'size': 'ADULT', 'bulb type': 'LED', 'number of items': '1', 'season': 'ALL', 'usage': 'OUTDOORS', 'sport': 'HEADLAMP', 'included components': 'HC60 Headlamp, Nitecore 18650 battery (3400mAh), Spare O-ring, button cover, USB charging cord, Ac & Car USB Adapters', 'batteries included?': 'No', 'battery description': '1x 18650 or 2x CR123As', 'brand': 'Nitecore', 'item weight': '226 g'}","#443,402 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1,RYZRKWKZYFTQ6,True,Use only the proprietary li-ion cell if you charge from USB,"I wanted to buy another Thrunite TH-10, but apparently no longer available, so I bought this Nitecore.

The bad: To permit charging via a USB port, this light uses a special 18650 cell which has a charge regulator built-in. This makes the cell about 4mm longer than normal, and it may not fit into common off-line regulated chargers. (I doesn't fit mine.) It will function with normal 18650 cells, (I had to stretch the spring in the cap), but if you use them do NOT use the USB charging port. Normal cells will overcharge, which is known to cause mayhem. Better design would have the charge regulator built into the light instead of requiring a special cell. Or just omit the USB charging feature altogether. Personally, I'm sure I'll never use it.
Unlike the TH-10, this one gives you no warning that the battery is low. It just shuts off. Could be very dangerous if I were, say, treading on treacherous ground, or working with a heavy object or, as I do, driving my tractor which has no lights of its' own. to or from the barn. Not good.

Max lumens are less than the TH-10, and it's very noticeable outdoors. Adequate, but IMHO only barely.

The on-off button is awkward, vs. the TH-10. Edit: After 3 weeks using it, the button is VERY awkward. I usually have to take it completely off my head to turn it on/off. Button is almost flush with the case, so it's next to impossible to find it by feel.

The good:
I like the lighter weight and lesser standoff vs. the TH-10. It is definitely more comfortable to wear. I hope I'll get used to the weird on/off button with time. Edit: I haven't.

2,R6I8XXJQVO2VU,True,The best headlamp on the market...,"I am somewhat of a flashlight junkie and I have a number of those cheap $15 rechargeable (18650) flashlights all over my house, shop & barn for those just in case moments. However, it is my high end flashlights/headlamps that I love to use the most and I have many. My favorite lights are manufactured by oLight and Nitecore. I used to be a big Surefire fan but NOT ONE of the several SureFires I owned works today. I sold the lot of them at a yard sale for $5, not lying.

I am retired and dable much of the day. Most any day you will find me wandering around my home with my HC60's resting on my head, like a hat. I have worn the headlamps for so long now I forget they are on my head and my wife often has to remind me to take them off my head. The honest truth is almost every day the HC60's comes in handy for something. Since they rest on my head, they free up that arm that I ordinarily would need to hold a torch. Nor, do I have to reach into my pocket and search for a light among my keys, pocket knife, change, screws and whatever else I have in my pocket on that day.

I have established how much I like the HC6, its convenience and how comfortable it is to wear. You can go days without charging it and with the included cable just plug it into any USB port to charge. How is the light itself? It has 5 different brightness levels of which I use the 2nd brightness the most, 3, 4 and 5 are usually very bright for my needs. The HC60 is everything Nitecore claims it to be in the description. I am thrilled with this light and would buy another in a heartbeat.",the united states,"October 9, 2017",Mupuman,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:15:31.006201,2020-11-12 15:15:31.276999,"Nitecore HC60 1000 Lumen USB Rechargeable LED Headlamp, 3400 mAh 18650 Included Plus LumenTac Car & AC USB Adapters",4.6,136.42,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01JGYRBA2,,"#443,402 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3,R3G18XQR61RDLB,True,Great flashlight. They thought of everything.,"Great flashlight and well built. They even give you 2 extra O-rings, and a gasket for the control switch and light section. The rechargeable battery charges to 4.2V max while (2) CR123 batteries (not included) provide 6.4V of power. However, I can't imagine any need for power exceeding the rechargeable battery 4.2V other than to have in case of emergency. My flashlight came charged to 3.8V and recommends not charging till the performance level decreases. The English instructions are actually well written for a product made in China. It also has 3 special modes (strobe, SOS - I think, and another special mode that I can't remember at the moment). Finally, when you insert the battery(ies), the control switch blinks to let you know what the voltage level is so you don't have to wonder if you will need to charge the battery soon. All in all, they thought about everything including comfort. I bought the headlight flashlight for hunting and any household projects done in the dark and I am very satisfied with my purchase.

5,R3GH8LVHAP7JHH,True,Headband is awful,"I'm a Nitecore fan, but this product isn't the clear winner that their other lights have been. On a positive note, I like the brightness and color of the neutral light lamp. I find myself using it on just the second lowest setting for most close-up work.

However, I agree with others that it would be nice if the cap didn't need to be completely removed to charge the battery. I also wish the operating button was located on either the top or bottom of the unit, instead of the front. When operating the unit, your hand instinctively grabs the top and bottom, and that's where the control should be. Instead, you have to feel around to find the button.

Most importantly, the unit is unbalanced, and has a tendency to slide forward. This is compounded by a headband that is too thin, and constantly loosens itself. This is frustrating under normal household usage, but I can't imagine using the lamp at all during any sort of vigorous activity. I replaced my headband with one I cannibalized off a Princeton Tec unit, which mostly resolved the issue. In the absence of any improvement in this area, my suggestion is to consider the Fenix HL60R instead.",the united states,"October 19, 2018",James Savage,3.0,0,2020-11-12 15:15:31.797020,2020-11-12 15:15:32.120526,"Nitecore HC60 1000 Lumen USB Rechargeable LED Headlamp, 3400 mAh 18650 Included Plus LumenTac Car & AC USB Adapters",4.6,136.42,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01JGYRBA2,,"#443,402 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

7,R1JRHGRCRKKHMI,True,"Lightweight, bright, secure head harness","I purchased this headlamp from Amazon on January 6, 2020. I don't like to post reviews on items like this 5 days after they arrive. I need time to evaluate their performance over time and I've had 8+ months to use the light and determine it's strengths and areas of development. I'll keep it simple with Pro/Con

Pro:
- Lightweight and very bright on high power. I used this head lamp on a miserable winter night in February to change a tire in a snow storm and it was excellent. That night alone sold me on this headlamp.
- I Like the X/Y axis head strap configuration. If you're not sure what that means, there is one strap that goes around your head and another one that goes over the top - it's very secure.
- Fit and finish of the light unit is excellent. It's nicely machined, threads are tight and it's well thought out with the micro USB connector under the waterproof cap.
- Uses rechargeable 18650 battery or 2 x CR 123 lithium disposable battery. The code number on the Nitecore battery is not 18650 but it's the same size.
- Does NOT require a special battery charger - works with a USB cable with a micro USB end with any phone
charger.
- Holds a charge for a long time. I've gone 3 months without touching this head light and it still performs perfectly. The battery drain over time is minimal, even when stored in a cold and then hot garage.
- The battery charges quickly as long as you don't run it down to dead.

Con:
-Nothing really comes to mind after 8+ months of using this headlamp 30+ times in really bad cold weather and in really good hot weather.

Overall, this is a great headlamp. I was going to buy a SureFire Maximus for $250 and I'm really happy I didn't waste the $$ because the Nitecore has done it all for me so far - hope that helps!",the united states,"September 2, 2020",Rolidnot,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:15:32.407696,2020-11-12 15:15:32.689472,"Nitecore HC60 1000 Lumen USB Rechargeable LED Headlamp, 3400 mAh 18650 Included Plus LumenTac Car & AC USB Adapters",4.6,136.42,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01JGYRBA2,,"#443,402 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

8,RQMTC0XLXL3C3,True,Great light. Would highly recommend and shipping was fast...,"I have quite a few head lamps and all are made by Streamlight until I purchased this light. I must say I am highly pleased with this light so far.. Most head lamps rated at around 1000 lumens always for some reason tend to always have a spot type light pattern that throws light at a great distance and sometimes that’s nice but this Nitecore HC60 is super bright, throws light a good distance while also giving you a great wider degree of light as well. It’s like a great spot and flood all in one. It also seems to be built very rugged without all of the weight. Great light overall that I would highly recommend and the shipping was fast.

10,R2MW2ML07VMHR4,True,Very Useful,"I'm a wind turbine tower inspector, so vision is important. I've had this thing for a couple months, in all kinds of weather, and it's hands-down the best headlamp I've ever had.

Good points:
-Maximum brightness level
-Brightness options from very low to very high
-""SOS"" and strobe options are easy to activate
-Rechargeable without having to remove battery
-Low battery level results in a non-adjustable brightness setting that is bright enough to navigate with, but doesn't drain too fast. Leaves enough juice in the battery to get out of the darkness.
-Easily adjusted straps
-Easy to use button, works while wearing thick winter gloves

The few problems with it include:
-Straps loosen easily. I have a petzl helmet though, so I just put the buckle behind the helmet's strap-keeper, and problem is solved.
-Button positioned on front, instead of on top, like normal. Easy to get used to, though.
-When turning it on with the one button, it is easy to over-shoot the second brightness level and jump straight to strobe setting. Not a big deal, but can be awkward and surprising.

11,R1LO55Y7OSU0E,True,Great headlamp - Superior to Fenix HL60R,"I have been using a Fenix HL60R for over a year. It's a night headlamp, but the mount starts wearing after a few months, meaning that the light can rotate up or down very easily. The light is still functional, but there will come a time when I will have to modify the lamp mount to make it more stable. The mount for the Nitecore HC60 is much more stable than the HL60R ever was. The next to the highest setting and the highest setting on the Nitecore HC60 are definitely brighter than the Fenix HL60R, though both headlamps project beautiful light.

I'm not a big fan of USB charging. I use an Opus BT-C3400 to keep my 18650 batteries in good condition, but having USB charging as an option could come in handy when I don't have access to my home chargers. Both headlamps are equally comfortable to wear. Based on the more durable light mount, I would pick the Nitecore HC60 over the Fenix HL60R. Both headlamps produce a lot of light and can be adjusted to several brightness settings.

12,RGJ7N2DH2JZIB,True,Excellent light,"I've had many head lamps, and this is my new favorite. First of all I like headlights that use a single 18650 cell, and this one comes with a protected 18650 3400 mA cell (made in China) which itself is a $10+ battery. One downside is that the beam is not focusable like my previous two headlights, but the 1000 lumins makes up for it. I really like these features:

- Warm white light option (best for rain and fog, and won't keep you up at night, less blue)
- 1 lumen output (night) that won't kill your night vision (and I can read with it) with 680h (that 4 weeks) burn time
- The 2nd mode is 38 lumens (25 hours) which I find is perfect for product work (working on my boat, house, car, etc).
- Very solid construction with nothing to break
- Won't accidentally turn on when packed
- Battery level indicator
- Waterproof (so I can use it on my dingy in the rain)
- Price is right, esp with the battery

139,R240B1L0OLOYM7,True,It was good while it lasted,"I got mine at the end of January and it worked great during the open window for returns......but come March 4th the window closed and my headlight hasn't turned on much since.

Apart from only having a few month lifespan the headlamp was well designed save for when recharging an end cap must be removed to reveal the Mini USB plug. With nowhere to store the little piece on the body of the headlamp It gets separated, I finally put a piece Velcro on it and on the headlamp to keep the piece from getting misplaced. The light works fine without the cap end cover So I was constantly grabbing my headlamp to head out without remembering the little piece was suppose to be screwed back on.

I have been a long fan of Nitecore -My two mainstay flashlights for years have been a surefire Lawman plus an early model Nitecore rechargeable.

This headlamp, while it felt in hand robust, really was not up to Nitecore's normal bulletproof standards. I have periodically gone back to the headlamp to give it another chance at charging up hoping It will come alive. I had hoped that its underlying robustness might pull it back to work and something might realign or connect back together and I could have a working headlamp again. That technique worked twice after it broke,but alas, there has been no spark of life in it for too long now to expect light from it.
Ratings: After all it did work well to start so I gave each full month of use It gave me one star.

152,R5KKXRDGLX17M,True,It will easily light up my entire yard in the middle of ...,"This headlamp is insanely bright. It will easily light up my entire yard in the middle of the night. The multiple light modes provide enough options to suit the situation. Headband is comfortable and easily adjusted. Came with some replacement seals and and button covers in case the originals wear out. Turns out the lamp itself has a usb input for charging. I didn't realize this until I removed the opposite cap from the light and discovered a micro usb port. That is a nice feature too, but I haven't tried it as I charge the batteries separately.

The only complaint I have about this light is its tendency to get very hot! On high intensity constant light modes the lamp gets warm enough that my head will sweat. This is somewhat to be expected with such a small package putting out high intensity light. The device actually dissipates the head fairly well.

263,R2QC5R09PFFSE7,True,Fantastic headlamp,"This is probably Nitecore's best headlamp (as of summer 2016). It is very bright and has a wide beam to ligh up a large area in front of you. The spacing of the brightness levels is well done. The second level is perfect for walking on a sidewalk or well established trail. I would prefer to have the button on one of the sides as to not have the beam obstructed any when changing settings but this is not a deal breaker. I greatly appreciate that when turning on the light it defaults to the lowest setting as to not destroy anyone with its 1000 ""eye scorching"" lumens. You do have the option though to turn on the light to the last setting by holding the button down for more than 1 second but less than 2. Holding it down for more than 2 makes it jump to turbo from the previously used setting.

It is fairly comfortable to wear though I have not worn it for extended periods. Since you must completely remove the side cap to plug in the USB I'd rather just remove the battery and use my D4 charger (you can even put the cap back on a few turns as to keep it from running away unlike when using the built in USB). The light stays put at the angle you adjust it and will not move on its own.

It is slightly inconvenient that the special modes must be accessed when the light is off. From off, you double tap to get into strobe and single tap to get to SOS and beacon. Double tapping while the light is on only makes it cycle through two levels.

Overall highly pleased. It will be nice to use this at work instead of holding my MT10C in my mouth. Well worth $60 especially since it comes with the huge 3400mAh battery. Would definitely recommend to anyone needing a quality headlamp.",the united states,"August 21, 2016","Trust me, I'm not a hipster",5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:18:26.556954,2020-11-12 15:18:26.774384,"Nitecore HC60 1000 Lumen USB Rechargeable LED Headlamp, 3400 mAh 18650 Included Plus LumenTac Car & AC USB Adapters",4.6,136.42,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01JGYRBA2,,"#443,402 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

267,R5BE8NUFXCPJ4,True,Died after a few seconds of use!.... maybe not... wtf is happening?,"Unboxed it, charged it for 6 hours, turned on, switched through the different modes a couple of times, then it DIED.... or at least, that's what it seemed initially, I tried all sorts of button combinations to try to switch it back on, removed the battery, keeping the button pressed while removing and mounting the battery.. nothing... I was already filling in the return request, then all of a sudden, 30 min later, the power button started blinking again so I could turn it back on again. Re-ran through the different modes and again the same issue. I think there is a bug when you switch the lamp off when it is in SOS mode.
