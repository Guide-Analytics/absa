8,R1LKVDLR0VWQY6,True,YESSS! My new Favorite flashlight,"Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen USB-C Rechargeable Tactical Flashlight.
I love flashlights - don't know why. I attach a lanyard to each new one and string it from a peg hanger with all the others. I like being able to instantly grab one, race outside and blast light on something needing immediate attention. And I want to see very well when the object is close, the far side of the lawn or across the street. I HATE clicking a flashlight and getting very dim or no light at all when new batteries were added a few weeks earlier.
This is the best I've used. I received it July 1 and it took longer than I expected for a 1st time charge - maybe a couple of days. But the brightness and distance are amazing. The Fenix website says the turbo setting output is 1600 lumens at just over 900 feet - I haven't measured but that seems right. it is very bright. Per Fenix, it’s waterproof for 30 mins under water 6 feet deep and drop proof from 5 feet. I've used it a number of times at turbo - and for about 45 mins on a middle setting and the battery indicator shows still strong. The body does get hot quickly on turbo – but that’s normal LED heat dissipation in aluminum.
The one thing I’d like it doesn’t have is a turbo brightness setting with a very narrow beam. But this is my first Fenix and I’ll look for that next time. I highly recommend this one.",the united states,"July 22, 2020",catchcan,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:41:29.384242,2020-11-12 11:41:29.546807,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen USB-C Rechargeable Tactical Flashlight with Fenix Battery and LumenTac Battery Organizer,4.8,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TKDJ5Q7,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ov57Lfp3L._AC_SX425_.jpg

It’s brighter than my TK20R that puts out 1,000 lumen but I like the tighter beam on my TK20R as i use it to spot voles, raccoons, opossums, snakes, and anything else slithering around my place in the night, while this light is perfect for her to flood a larger area to detect any boogie men lurking when she goes out at night. I use mine more than 2 hours every night continuously with medium beam, turbo for a couple of min when I’ve spotted a critter I want to watch. I’ve dropped it several times and it’s still great.

13,R20NGRF708KCOZ,True,Fantastic compact flashlight,"I haven't had a chance to try this out in a functional situation yet, but in my testing the light has been very bright, with a very durable construction. I am particularly fond of the separate operating buttons, where the rear button only turns the light on or off, with the side button operating the various modes. The battery seems ok so far, but as mentioned I haven't had it long enough to notice issues. I will mention that the light gets a bit warm when charging via USB-C. I don't have an external battery charger yet, so I'll need to keep an eye on this to see if it develops into an issue. So far though, just warmer than expected, not too warm to cause issues.",the united states,"March 29, 2020",Irish con carne,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:41:32.261517,2020-11-12 11:41:32.389090,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen USB-C Rechargeable Tactical Flashlight with Fenix Battery and LumenTac Battery Organizer,4.8,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TKDJ5Q7,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ov57Lfp3L._AC_SX425_.jpg
14,R2GDY83PJSVMUT,True,Best Self Defense Flashlight for Office Professionals,"I bought this flashlight mostly to be a self-defense weapon that I can carry anywhere, including in a medical office setting. I also wanted one that was useful for other lighting tasks. So, I needed something really powerful, that can fit in a dress shirt pocket, and not look too much like a weapon.

High lumens are important, but not the only factor that makes a flashlight effective for self defense. It also needs to focus the light into a bright spot. This light has a smooth deep reflector that does just that. The spot is also wide enough to cover an attacker's entire visual field. The color of the light adds to its intensity.

The length is not too long, and not too short. If stand the light straight up in my shirt pocket, it does protrude above the pocket a little. If I let it slip diagonally, It is pretty much concealed, and no one has commented on it. When I grasp it in my palm, it extends an inch and a half from the side of my hand. That is the perfect size for a striking weapon.

It's a pretty light, with the smooth black finish and gold side switch. It has a serrated bezel that makes it an effective striking or scraping weapon. It does not have aggressive crenellation, that can ruin a pocket or scare the staff if pull it out for other uses. The knurling consists of horizontal grooves, which is the most effective pattern to prevent it from slipping out of my hand if I do strike with it.

A classic recommendation for a self defense flashlight is that the operation is simple, and it will turn on at the greatest intensity, with a focused spot and not accidentally slip into non fighting modes like SOS or low light. One strategy is a light that only has one mode, and no variable focus. Then the light is only effective for self dense or seeing long distances. Other lights have multiple modes, and come on at the brightest mode, but if you hit the switch again, it will switch to the lowest intensity. Some lights have complicated programs, to make it turn on and stay in the desired mode. This light simply turns on in the mode it was last on, and unless you hit the side switch, it will not go into other modes. If you hold the side switch down, It will go into an irregular strobe pattern that is really disorienting.

Boy, this has been a long review. I hope it is useful to someone.",the united states,"September 5, 2020",Timothy,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:41:32.394077,2020-11-12 11:41:32.537693,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen USB-C Rechargeable Tactical Flashlight with Fenix Battery and LumenTac Battery Organizer,4.8,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TKDJ5Q7,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ov57Lfp3L._AC_SX425_.jpg
