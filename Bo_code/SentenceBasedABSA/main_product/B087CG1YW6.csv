0,R211J2YCVHKS90,True,Absolut Spitze!!!,"Excellenter Service durch Pixxass. Super schnelle Lieferung und 1 A Produkt. Die Fenix Pd40r 2.0 ist eine fantastische Lampe. Super Hell. Komfortabler Ring Schalter, der nicht so leicht versehentlich eingeschaltet wird. Was mir bei Fenix im Vergleich zu anderen Herstellern wie Olight besonders gefällt, ist die Möglichkeit auch mehrere 21700er Akkus (die neuen mit 5000 mAh in externen Ladegeräten (auch von Fenix) schnell und sicher ablesbar laden zu können. So weiß man genau, dass der Akku wirklich vollständig geladen ist und nicht nur beinahe. Ladestation Fenix ARE-A2 oder 4.
Die neue Pd40r 2.0 ist eine Wucht. 3000 Lumen reichen für fast alle Zwecke. Dabei bleibt die Lampe äußerst kompakt und ist super bequem bedienbar. Gleichzeitig verhindert der drehbare Ein/Aus und Helligkeits Schalter ein versehentliches Betätigen. Fenix macht mich glücklich. Andere Hersteller sind immer nur ein Kompromiss, zumal dort oft die maximale Helligkeit nur für einen sehr kurzen Zeitraum möglich ist und dann schnell zurück geregelt wird.",germany,"July 28, 2020",jwk1201,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:24:44.178951,2020-11-12 11:24:44.325560,"Fenix PD40R v2 3000 Lumen Mechanical Rotary Switch Operated USB-C Rechargeable LED Flashlight, includes 5000mAh Battery",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B087CG1YW6,"{'manufacturer': 'Fenix Flashlights', 'part number': 'PD40R+ORG217', 'product dimensions': '13.79 x 3.33 x 2.59 cm; 117.08 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.

2,RXFAAED2CJJS6,True,Probably not the right flashlight for me.,"I can say without a doubt it is a very good quality light with pretty good battery life and durable construction.

Everyone has their own preferences so mine may not represent everyone but this is how I would change the light.
1. put a tactical switch on the back - keep the slider switch for light intensity but use the tactical switch to engage or not the light.
2. This light favors pocket-ability over tactical and use IMHO. If the barrel was longer it would be more function for defense or breaking a window. Also with a longer barrel it would be able to house a longer battery for greater up time. Lastly a longer barrel sits in your hand better and would reduce the chance you'd hold it near the very hot light tip. You could say this isn't a tactical light but why put the raised ends designed for damaging things on the ends if that is the case?

Things that would be a bonus IMHO -
I like the magnetic connectors that cover type C so you can have easy plug or location plugging depending on where you are and what you have to charge.
I'd like a digital LCD display to show charging status and battery capacity.

I'll probably return the light but it doesn't mean it isn't a fine light, just not what I want for $120 and unlike some people I think more than one $100 flashlight is more than I need.",the united states,"July 15, 2020",Jim M.,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:24:44.460336,2020-11-12 11:24:44.583008,"Fenix PD40R v2 3000 Lumen Mechanical Rotary Switch Operated USB-C Rechargeable LED Flashlight, includes 5000mAh Battery",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B087CG1YW6,,"#69,102 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

6,R1GQM6B2II12GH,True,"High intensity, High quality flashlight","I bought this flashlight to keep beside my living room recliner for: room lighting, reading, searching for things, and home defense. I also wanted a flashlight a little larger and more powerful than my EDC, Fenix PD36R, that I could carry in a coat pocket in the cooler weather. This light is capable of performing all of those tasks well.

The size is just right for keeping in a shallow drawer, coat pocket, or pants pocket. The bezel is mildly crenulated, making it an effective striking weapon, but it doesn't look like a scary weapon to people unfamiliar with tactical flashlights.

The light output appears to be as advertised. I have no device to measure it, but it is much brighter than my 1600 lumen Fenix light, and that is brighter that a 1400 lumen light. Like any modern high output flashlight, it does begin to slowly dim from turbo to protect the LED and my hand. It does this more gradually than other lights, and the dropdown is not as steep as other lights. I have come across two manufacturers that advertise their light ""may be as much as"" a high number of lumens. Then they start out very bright, but dim a lot after a few seconds. Niether of my Fenix lights do that nonsense.

It has a deep smooth reflector, so it focuses the light to an intense hot spot, and throws a long distance. I took it out on the beach where I live, and it does project a few football fields on the sand or water.

It does have the capability to be a self defense light, but because of the switch mechanism, my PD36R will continue to serve that role for carrying. It has a rotary switch that can be used to quickly activate turbo or strobe, but it takes two hands, and can not be instantly turned off. A tail based momentary switch is probably best for carrying it around outside, but this light is still great for a home defense light.

The rotary switch does make it more practical for doing non defensive tasks as you can easily select any light level. The absence of a tail switch makes it possible to stand it on its tail and light up a room.

I'm very satisfied with this light and highly recommend it. For me, it is a second Fenix light that is very high quality and performs very well.",the united states,"October 2, 2020",Timothy,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:24:44.980943,2020-11-12 11:24:45.102618,"Fenix PD40R v2 3000 Lumen Mechanical Rotary Switch Operated USB-C Rechargeable LED Flashlight, includes 5000mAh Battery",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B087CG1YW6,,"#69,102 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

7,R11NSZH0YF7ASG,True,Happy with my purchase,"This light is every bit as bright as I'd hoped it would be. I never fail to get a ""damn that thing is bright"" comment out of whoever I am using it around. In turbo mode, the head of the flashlight heats up quick, and feeling that reminds me that I shouldn't leave it in turbo mode too long. The switching mechanism works well, but I am constantly putting the light into strobe mode instead of turbo. Probably when I've had more time with the light I will stop doing that, I just wish that strobe wasn't one click away from turbo. As for durability, I've only had the light for a month, but all is well so far. I think the version 1 of this light had a failure at the switch over time, and I hope that isn't an issue with this 2nd version.",the united states,"July 12, 2020",CM,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:24:45.106608,2020-11-12 11:24:45.239008,"Fenix PD40R v2 3000 Lumen Mechanical Rotary Switch Operated USB-C Rechargeable LED Flashlight, includes 5000mAh Battery",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B087CG1YW6,,"#69,102 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

9,R3TG8ONJJCFKZK,True,"Not bright, not 3000 lumens, too expensive","I have a 40 dollar Slydeking flashlight that puts this one to shame. This cost 120.00 and is barely ""brighter"" on the highest mode.The Slydeking is rated 500 lumens. The PD40R is 3000?? No way. It has different brightness selections on the rotator switch. Low med, high, super and flash. Guess what. There is absolutely no difference in medium, high or super bright. All three positions have the same exact brightness.

12,R3LBWLDLNS43B3,True,Crazy bright,"This thing is a powerhouse. By far the brightest flashlight I have ever owned, let alone this small. This compares to my 2 mill candlepower spotlight, but unlike that, this is a small one handed flashlight. I also own the Fenix pd35 v2 and this is noticeably brighter and wider. It does seem to use up battery power and lose some lumens fairly quickly while on the brightest setting. I'd say about 20mins of constant use on full blast and youll start to notice slight lumen loss down to the 1200lm range (High setting but not turbo), I'd say it takes about 1-2hrs before it is all the way down to 1200.

I use this flashlight 5 days a week at intermittent times of use throughout an 8hour day. I give this product a 4star rating only because turbo mode, 3k lumen, doesn’t last as long as I would prefer. The battery has to be completely charged for this mode, which for me is often daily. If the battery life were better I’d give this product a 5star rating.

Having said all that, this flashlight is still a good product and I will continue to be a Fenix customer in the future.",the united states,"August 24, 2020",Nate Turman,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:24:53.350055,2020-11-12 11:24:53.490209,"Fenix PD40R v2 3000 Lumen Mechanical Rotary Switch Operated USB-C Rechargeable LED Flashlight, includes 5000mAh Battery",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B087CG1YW6,,"#69,102 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
