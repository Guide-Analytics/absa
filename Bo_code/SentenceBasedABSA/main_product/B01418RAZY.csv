I also own the FD 11 both are great lights I EDC the FD 11 and I use the LD 22 at work.I'm happy with the build quality. I prefer to use a AA at work because the batteries are inexpensive.

9,R19ABBNG2G7FBU,False,Very versatile light.,"I received this as a gift after owning the previous ld 20 model for years (still works great even after shallow water diving)

This and previous and the previous LD20 has been my go to light for years.

Pros
-practical brightness levels
-mode memory (always comes on in the last mode you used)
-small enough to carry everyday
-runs on AA's = easy to find anywhere
-waterproof/durable
-great runtimes

CONS
-pocket clip cannot be re positioned to the head
-pocket clip doesn't seem secure enough for me to not worry about it when hiking (if your pocket isn't deep enough) but it does come with a belt sheath.
with that said, the clip is perfect for everyday carry and wont tear up your pants.
-cannot tail stand
-the runtime on turbo leaves something to be desired.

12,R2Z1KVXL0GQ7NN,True,Lovely,"I bought this to replace my old LD20 that I keep in the ‘glove box’ on my BMW R1200RT motorbike but the case is slightly different and won’t fit the clip in the bike. I didn’t need to replace it as it still works beautifully, but I like torches, so I have kept it and put it in my car!!

I should give it 5 stars as it is awesome, however, I bought the ‘Fenix PD35 Tactical Edition 1000 Lumen LED Torch’ at the same time (I REALLY like torches!) and the PD35 is even more awesome.

If you regularly use AA batteries and don’t want the hassle of dealing with the bigger 18650 batteries, then get this one, you won’t be disappointed.

If though you either have some 18650s or are interested in getting some, get the PD35, it will shine all the way to the moon (not literally).

13,R12Y5I10SUOTV2,True,The Best 2 x AA Torch,"Be careful to buy this (300 lumens) and not the older 215 lumens model with the same model name. You'll see this one sometimes referred to as LD22 (2015). I sometimes just searched for ""LD22 300"".

Very good torch, I bought this and the LD41 (960 Lumens) and this is my favourite one to carry and use as the LD41 is too heavy and awkward to hold for long periods of time. The LD22 (2015) is more than bright enough for around the house and perfect for streets but isn't as floody or throwy as the LD41. The battery life is decent and for those complaining about it immediately jumping to a lower power, it does that when the voltage from the batteries are low to protect the electronics.

A torch with a Cree XP-L might be brighter than this with an XP-G2, take a look also at the Thrunite Archer 2A (though I couldn't find that on Amazon) but I found a lot of posts online saying Fenix tend to have better build quality. This is Fenix's brightest 2AA torch at present (until they switch to XP-L, XP-L (V5) or XP-L (V6) LEDs and combined with the build quality I'd argue the best 2AA torch at present.

For those considering a £2 Amazon torch that claims to match the same number of lumens (or any of the cheap eBay torches quoting more lumens), my dad purchased one of those and in a tiny square LED shaped spot it was slightly brighter, the beam was far less floody and did not accurately light up the area. The overall output is far better with the Fenix.

My biggest product suggestion is that the wrist-strap is not adjustable and it really should be to make the wrist-strap useful. Fix that and it's perfect (well until the XP-L, or whatever is the brightest LED version comes out too) :-).",the united kingdom,"January 30, 2016",Matthew1471!,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:18:32.568836,2020-11-12 11:18:32.702625,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

14,R2YE52FMKTP4J1,True,Versatile LED torch - excellent quality,"The Fenix LD22 is a very nice LED torch, powerful and sturdy. It runs on 2x AA batteries and higher-quality batteries will last longer.

The tail switch changes between high, low, SOS and strobe, whilst the silver-coloured side switch changes between 4 settings of brightness - 5 lumens, 30 lumens, 100 lumens and 300 lumens. When you replace the batteries you have to turn the torch on, then press the side button for 3 seconds and hold it until the LED blinks and goes from low to high. After that, a single press will cycle through the different intensity levels.

The torch comes with a spare ""O"" ring, a good quality lanyard and a metal pocket clip that can be attached either up or down, or removed if you prefer. There's also a belt pouch with velcro closure and 2x AA batteries. The torch can be opened both ways; i.e., the bezel and the tail cap both unscrew. This makes it easy to remove a stuck battery - some rechargeable batteries have a slightly thicker case than alkaline batteries.

All in all it's very high quality and I can't fault it. If I wanted to be really picky I suppose the material that the belt pouch is made from is a little on the thin side, but I can't fault the torch itself.",the united kingdom,"December 2, 2015",Jinx,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:18:32.708611,2020-11-12 11:18:32.860711,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

57,RTSJQ4ECHUUQJ,True,Genial,"Entscheidend für den Kauf war bei mir die Auslegung auf AA-Batterien. Solche Taschenlampen gibt es eher weniger, aber für häufigen, fast täglichen Gebrauch sind diese Spezial-Batterien, die sonst immer benötigt werden, schlichtweg viel zu teuer, selbst als Akkus noch. Da gefällt es doch, dass die LD22 auf eine deutlich billiger erhältliche Norm setzt und zudem klein, leicht und handlich ist. Der erste Eindruck war stabil und robust. Das 2-Schalter-Design gefällt mir. Am Ende ein/aus, an der Seite wird die Helligkeit reguliert, bzw. bei langem Drücken zwischen Stroboskop (mit 2 wechselnden Frequenzen) oder SOS und normalem Leuchtmodus umgeschaltet. Die Bedienung ist also ein Kinderspiel.

Die Lampe liegt gut und locker in der Hand, ohne dabei schwerfällig zu wirken, lässt sich aber auch super z.B. als Fahrradlicht verwenden. Der Griff ist dabei angeraut, sodass einem die Lampe auch bei glitschigen oder nassen Händen nicht entgleiten kann, ohne aber dabei wenigstens annähernd zu stören oder unangenehm zu sein. Ein schönes Detail, das man eher selten so angenehm abgestimmt vorfindet. Die Leuchtkraft ist dabei mehr als ausreichend, insbesondere im Turbomodus sieht man locker 100 Meter voraus. Nur die Leuchtdauer ist etwas ernüchternd. Im Turbo-Modus hält ein frischer Akku bei mir gerade mal 20-30 Minuten, bei extremer Kälte höchstens eine Viertelstunde, im High-Modus immerhin knappe 3 Stunden. Für einen Spaziergang also absolut ausreichend. Bei absoluter Dunkelheit und abgelegen von der Straße reicht aber auch der Mid-Modus schon vollkommen aus, um einigermaßen sehen zu können. Dann kommt man auch problemlos mit einer Akkuladung über die Woche bei täglich 1,5- bis 2-stündigem Gebrauch. Auf einem beleuchteten Gehsteig wäre dieser Modus allerdings hinfällig, da ist jede Straßenleuchte heller.

Schön finde ich, dass die Taschenlampe die Leuchtkraft trotz fallender Batteriespannung bis kurz vor Ebbe nahezu konstant halten kann. Erst wenn der Akku auch tatsächlich leer ist sackt die Leuchtkraft relativ rasch auf ein Minimum ab, was in etwa dem Low-Modus entspräche. Dass es die Lampe dann nicht mehr versucht, die ihr vorgegebene Leistung zu erreichen, wäre gelogen, sie blitzt weiterhin ab und zu hell auf. Der Akku schafft es dann nur nicht mehr, die Energie bereit zu stellen, die vom Chip gebraucht wird, um den Kondensator durchgehend geladen zu halten. Die Lampe geht dann auch nicht aus, sondern leuchtet wacker weiter und würde das wahrscheinlich auch noch so lange tun, bis der Akku endgültig tiefentladen ist. So wird man, auch wenn man selbst kaum noch was sehen kann, von anderen Verkehrsteilnehmern wenigstens nicht übersehen, wenn man keine Ersatzbatterien dabei hat.

Der Strobe funktioniert dann nicht mehr, immerhin braucht der die volle Leuchtkraft und somit auch relativ viel Strom. Wenn man dann allerdings rein guckt (absolut nicht zu empfehlen!) ist der Blendeffekt selbst wenn es noch etwas heller ist enorm, insbesondere durch die wechselnde Frequenz das extrem helle Licht. Das verschafft einem genug Spielraum um sich kurz zu wehren und dann abzuhauen, sollte man tatsächlich in die seltene Ausnahmesituation geraten, dass einem einer an die Wäsche will. Wichtiges Detail ist hierbei, dass der Strobe nach dem Umschalten vom Dauerleuchten wirklich immer zuerst, also vor dem SOS kommt. Das Gegenüber wird sofort geblendet, ohne dass erst wichtige, wertvolle Zeit vergehen muss bis man begreift, dass der falsche Modus aktiv ist und man durch nochmaliges Drücken umschaltet. Das bedeutet, sofern man in einer Paniksituation überhaupt in der Lage ist, diesen Umstand zu begreifen. Ich zumindest habe den Eindruck, dass die Leute von Fenix hier auch bis zum Ende gedacht haben und nicht nur so ""La, la, dann bauen wir halt mal eine Taschenlampe"".

Stufe Low ist für den Außeneinsatz völlig überflüssig. Was will man mit so wenig Licht? Einziges Anwendungsgebiet wird wohl sein, wenn man nachts unter der Decke heimlich ein Buch lesen will, ohne dabei von den Eltern erwischt oder von den Reflexionen der Seiten geblendet werden zu wollen. Schlag- und Wasserfestigkeit habe ich nicht getestet. Ersteres wird aber wohl zutreffen, weil Fenix hier ganz sicher kein billiges Material zur Herstellung verwendet hat. Lustig finde ich die Hitze-Warnung am Kopf der Lampe. Davon war bisher nichts zu spüren. Ich glaube, bevor die erst so richtig heiß läuft ist der Akku schon lange leer.

Bei mir wurden 2xAA-Batterien mitgeliefert. Diese hatten allerdings nach nicht einmal fünf Minuten ihr Ende erreicht, kann man also eigentlich gleich dem Sondermüll zuführen anstelle sich die Mühe zu machen, die einzubauen und sofort zu wechseln. Die beworbene ""Kerzenersatzfunktion"" ist eine klare Lüge, für mich aber kein negatives Kriterium. Die Lampe bleibt nicht auf dem Rücken stehen, aber wer braucht bitte eine ""Kerze"", die nur zur Decke leuchten kann? Das ergibt doch keinen Sinn. Der Gürtelclip ist auch nicht in Silber/Hellgrau wie auf dem Bild, sondern - zumindest bei mir - in der selben, mattschwarzen Farbe wie die Lampe auch. An sich beides irrelevant, wollte es aber trotzdem erwähnt haben. Und wenn der Clip schon genannt wird, der zieht mit erstaunlicher Kraft. Wie die Lampe da ohne größere Gewalt noch von der Hose fallen soll, ist mir ein Rätsel.

Alles in allem ist der Preis für die Taschenlampe angemessen. Man bekommt etwas für das Geld, das man ausgibt (was in diesem Fall ja nicht wenig ist). Vergleicht man diese Lampe mit dem Schrott, den man für 20-30 Euro im Einzelhandel bekommt, müsste die LD22 sogar das Doppelte kosten. Zum Glück tut sie das aber nicht. An sich würde ich die Lampe was den Alltagsgebrauch angeht als perfekt geeignet bezeichnen. Nur die Akkulaufzeit könnte um einiges besser sein. Dafür würde ich zwei Sterne abziehen. Es wird allerdings auch das gewählte Format der Akkus als Kriterium (oder Leistungsobergrenze) mit hinein spielen, es kommt nicht umsonst bei fast allen Vergleichsmodellen dieses überteuerte Sonderformat zum Einsatz. Daher nur ein Stern Abzug und auch nur, weil die - neuen und hochwertigen - Akkus mit 20 Minuten bis drei Stunden bei den von mir meistverwendeten Leuchtmodi wirklich sehr schwachbrüstig wirken.",germany,"February 10, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:18:55.853163,2020-11-12 11:18:56.067591,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

58,R3P3F6HX8H3UK6,True,Erste Eindruecke,"Habe die Fenix LD22 - 2015 Edition heute erhalten. Die Lampe macht einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck. Auch wenn mir Langzeiterfahrungen fehlen, schliesse ich mich der Bewertung des Vorrezensenten (""Segelflugpilot"") an und moechte nur ein paar Beobachtungen hinzufuegen:

- Entgegen der Produktbeschreibung auf der Amazon Page bleibt mein Exemplar nicht auf der Endkappe stehen, denn der Ein-/Aus-Schalter ragt etwas ueber das Ende der Lampe hinaus. Die ""Kerzenersatzfunktion"" entfaellt also bei mir, wobei ich das nicht fuer schwerwiegend halte, denn: Selbst wenn der Schalter nicht ueber das Ende hinausragen wuerde, wuerde die Lampe auf diesem Ende nicht sehr stabil stehen. Ferner: Da man den Reflektor nicht getrennt von der Birne abschrauben kann, wuerde diese ""Kerze"" ihr Licht im Wesentlichen gebuendelt nach oben abstrahlen. (Beide Probleme hat meine alte MINI-MAGLITE nicht: Hier kann ich nur den Reflektor abschrauben und als Staender fuer die Lampe benutzen.)

- Durch den ueberstehenden Schalter am Ende der Lampe kann beim Verstauen versehentlich die Momentlichtfunktion ausgeloest werden. (Wenn ich die Lampe mit diesem Ende senkrecht fest auf die Schreibtischflaeche druecke, geht die Lampe an, ohne dass der Schalter klickt.) Das kann man vermeiden, indem man den Endschalter oder den Lampenkopf ein wenig loest; eine Vierteldrehung reicht bei mir schon aus. Dies empfiehlt Fenix auch explizit in der Bedienungsanleitung, allerdings nur in der englischen. Umgekehrt: Sollte die Lampe mal nicht leuchten wollen, sollte man auch pruefen, ob beide Enden fest verschraubt sind.

- Der Schalter am Ender der Lampe laesst sich recht gut als Taster fuer das Momentlicht verwenden, ohne Gefahr zu laufen, die Lampe permanent einzuschalten; fuer Letzteres muss man bedeutend mehr Kraft aufwenden.

- Der Drucktaster am Lampenkopf fuer die Helligkeitsstufen laesst sich vermutlich besser ertasten als bei den Vorgaengerversionen der LD 22.

- Fuer den sehr stabilen Halteclip gibt es im Gegensatz zu den Vorgaengerversionen der LD 22 nur eine Position. Den Clip kann man im Prinzip von der Lampe loesen (er wird nur durch seine grosse Federkraft gehalten), dazu benoetigt man aber wohl Werkzeug. Allerdings traegt der Clip ganz wesentlich zur Verhinderung des Wegrollens bei; daher habe ich ihn erst einmal drangelassen. Fuer die Brusttasche in einem Hemd taugt der Clip weniger, allein schon wegen des Gewichts der Lampe (123g mit zwei eneloop Akkus).

- Neben der letzten Helligkeitsstufe im Outdoor Modus merkt sich die Lampe auch, welcher Modus (Outdoor oder taktischer) zuletzt eingeschaltet war.

- Im Outdoor Modus kann die Leuchtstaerke auch bei Momentlicht durch den Druckschalter im Lampenkopf geregelt werden.

- Die Vorgaengerversionen der LD 22 hatten offenbar einen Bug: Im Outdoor Modus war die geringste Leuchtstaerke nicht verfuegbar, wenn in der Lampe frische Alkalibatterien mit einer Spannung groesser als 1,5 V steckten. Diese Fehlfunktion konnte ich bei meiner Lampe nicht festestellen.

- Im Gegensatz zu meiner MINI-MAGLITE passen eneloop Akkus sehr gut in die Lampe. Das Spiel zur Rohrwand ist aber nicht so gross, dass die Akkus bei Bewegungen Geraeusche verursachen.",germany,"October 26, 2015",coredump,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:18:56.073574,2020-11-12 11:18:56.219185,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

66,R26JPYABYQYNBW,True,明るさはともかく、いまいち納得がいかない。,"結論から言うと、「明るさやランタイムは十分。だが点灯・消灯以外の細かい操作は説明書を読まないとわからん。スイッチの配置や操作法が微妙で光量変更やストロボを気にする人は慣れかあきらめのどちらかが必要になるかも。」

以下ダラダラと詳細を記載。

仕事場での施錠確認の巡回などで同社のLD10を使用。しかし最大100ルーメンでは夜間に屋外から2，3階の窓の鍵が確認しづらいため、本品（最大300ルーメン）を購入。
※使用状況としては、普段はデスクの引き出しに保管。窓の鍵など高いところを見ることが多いため、逆手持ち（親指でテールスイッチ操作）をして視線の高さで使用している。周囲の人家に迷惑にならないよう光量調節は必須。一日15分程度、週3回ほど使用。

・説明書と付属品
説明書は6か国語だが日本語はない。保証書と広告のほか、クリップ（本体に装着済み）、ホルスター、アルカリ電池2本、ストラップと交換用のOリング2種（テール用とヘッド用）付属。
・電源
単3電池2本を使用するため電池の入手がしやすい。説明書によると本品はニッケル水素充電池の使用を「推奨」とのこと。アルカリ電池は「可」でニッケルの方がランタイムは長い。Li-ionの14500は「禁止」と記載がある。
・大きさと重量
太さ・長さはデスクの薄い引出しにも余裕で収まり、手で握り込むにはちょうどいい。重量は単1や単2を使う大型のものに比べれば、軽量なため疲れにくい。
・外装
滑り止めのチェッカリングはよく効く。テールにはストラップホールが2か所。隙間は2mmほどしかないのでストラップの取り付けには細いピンセットなどがないと苦労する。金属製のクリップは転がり止めになる。回転できるので、握る際に邪魔ならずらすことができる。どうしても邪魔なら外すことはできそうだが、素手では無理だろう…（工具を使っても本体が傷つくか、手を痛めそう。）それくらい頑丈に付いている。
・強度
説明書によれば1mの高さから落とした衝撃（どんな床にかは書いていない）に耐えられるとのこと。テールと筒部はアルミ、ヘッドとサイドスイッチはステンレス製。デザイン的にはテールスイッチとガラス面は周囲の突起に守られているが、サイドスイッチはむき出しで心配。
・防水性
IPX-8で2m防水。雨天での使用も全く心配にならない。
・光源
Cree XP-G2 R5搭載。「Digitally Regulated output maintains constant brightness」との記載から、何らかの安定化回路を搭載している？光の色はクール系でLD10よりも青みがかっているように感じるが、際立って青いわけではない。中央に満月のように均一なスポットができる。手元を見るには指向性が強いが、求める用途ではないので寧ろスポットの明るさの方がありがたい。ざっと見て照射角度は50度ほどでスポットは10度くらい。Turboで使っているとヘッド部が徐々に熱を帯びてくるが、素手で持てないほどではない。
・操作性
自分にとっては唯一のケチのつけどころ。設定変更で操作方法はアウトドアモードとタクティカルモードが選べるが、タクティカルではテール半押しで光量変更できるものの、光量をTurboからMidにするのに激しいストロボが間に入る。見る度に目がチカチカするので、アウトドアモードで使用しようとすると、光量の変更でストロボは入らなくなるが、今度はテール半押しが間欠点灯に代わり、光量変更にはサイドスイッチを押さなければいけない。ここで問題になるのは、そのサイドスイッチが前方すぎることである。順手で持った場合は親指がちょうどいい位置に来るが、点灯はテールスイッチだし、体に押し付けて点灯しようにも保護用の突起が邪魔で押し込めない。結局反対の手を使うか、逆手に持ち替えて親指で押し込むしかない。逆手で持って使えば点灯は楽だが、小指がサイドに届きそうで届かない。そうなるとまた反対の手を使うか、小指に届くように手の中で本体をスライドさせるわけだが、最初から小指をかけているならともかく、暗い中で薄く突起の少ないスイッチを不器用な小指で探しあてるのは難しい。何でこんな配置にしたのか…
（そもそもボタンが二つもあって、説明書を読みながらモード変更の仕方を覚えないと使いこなせない懐中電灯ってどうなの？という考え方もありますが…）",japan,"February 14, 2016",M.G.R.,3.0,0,2020-11-12 11:19:01.443128,2020-11-12 11:19:01.604696,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

70,R31RKR8GQBW22Q,True,Der Nachfolger und noch ein klein wenig besser,"Ich nutze seit Jahren Fenix-Lampe beruflich. Sie müssen für meine Verwendung vor allem langlebig, wasserfest, stoßfest, energieeffizien und eine gute Ausleuchtung im Nah- und Mittelbereich haben.
Vor einigen Jahren hatte ich den Vorgänger LD20 für fast 3 Jahre bei mir. Leider hatte ich einen beschädigten Akku und mir ist sehr viel Säure in das Innere gelaufen. Danach habe ich auf die LD40 (4xAA Batterien) umgerüstet, die auf Dauer an der Koppel/ Gürtel mir jedoch zu schwer wurde. Daher habe ich mich jetzt wieder für den verbesserten Nachfolger der LD20 - die LD22 entschieden.
Beim tragen merkt man sie kaum. Sie hat die Größe einer Zigarre aber die Leistung einer vergleichbaren 4AA-Batterien-Lampe. Die Ausleuchtung im Nahbereich ist bereits bei Stufe 2-3 sehr gut. Im Boostmodus ist eine Ausleuchtung selbst von größeren Flächen kein Problem. Der Taktikmodus kann durch den neuen Knopf am Kopf sehr schnell eingeschaltet werden. Wir haben die Strobofunktion getestet und war von ihrer Blendwirkung wirklich überzeugt. Selbst im Halbdunkeln war das Gegenüber vollkommen geblendet. Leider hat Fenix, im Gegensatz zum Vorgängermodell, die Lampe wieder komplett rund desingt (zuvor Sechskant am Kopf), was zur folge hat, dass sie auf ungeraden Flächen leicht ins Rollen kommt. Der kleine Klipp hält sie zwar bei Zeiten ab, sie kommt allerding bei größeren Neigungen trotzdem ins Rollen. Der Energieverbrauch ist perfekt. Im Winter müssen die Batterien circa alle 3 Wochen gewechselt werden (häufiger Gebrauch auf Stufe 2-3). Im Sommer musste lediglich mal nachgeschaut werden, ob die Batterien noch intakt sind. Ein Batteriewechsel war sehr selten.

71,R3AHUKSABAK9IY,True,Great light with many options,"Everybody wants something different from a flashlight. I am a little old school. I hate all the gimmicks in new flashlights. Fenix is a wonderful company. They did make a narrow long range light, which I loved, but they discontinued it. This flashlight has all the gimmicks that other people like, but Fenix put those gimmicks on a separate button, so I don't have to worry about them. I put it on bright and it stays on bright every time I turn it on. Like most of the new models, this light is a bit wide and short, compared to the old 22 model. I do not take this one hunting because it does not shoot out far enough for my satisfaction, but it is a great light for the campsite. It is also a great light to have in the car, or to take on walks. Fenix does not make a bad flashlight, I have several and each has it's own benefits.

72,R6G6K0ZANTJS7,True,"Sturdy, bright, light-weight, easy to use-- I recommend","Sturdy, bright, light-weight, easy to use. The LD22 (2015 Edition) by Fenix is an excellent choice for a high-end, small flashlight.

PROS:
- 300 Lumens is bright. Sure, I want 1000 lumens in each light I own, but that is simply not possible when other features are desired.

- takes 2 x AA batteries -- easy to replace anytime, anywhere. Brighter lights often take exotic battery sizes, and it is efficient to keep my lights with standard AAA or AA.

- easy to use. On-Off on the tail button, and there is a very handy, well-placed button for toggling between brightness settings near the lens cap of the light. The only minor flaw is that, in the dark, without looking, it is hard to find by touch -- it takes considerable practice if it is important to you to operate that button without looking at the flashlight. That is only worth subtracting 1 star, since that button is still awesome and a great idea.

- sturdy and tough aluminum. Water resistant o-rings and construction; though it is round, the LD22 has small construction
features or shapes on the shaft that keep it from rolling around -- great idea.

- compact for easy carry or storage -- sturdy clip is easily reversible.

CONS:

- As mentioned above, the three-toggle brightness button, if you need to find it without looking, requires it takes considerable practice. If you look, no problem.

- My light failed due to what the factory said was ""corrosion"" in under 2 years. I do not know if it was the FL salt air near the coast, but the light should be well-sealed against that. Maybe corrosion from batteries, but I found no corrosion myself. However, Fenix cheerfully and quickly cleaned it and returned the working LD22 with no charge. I will watch this carefully, as I have several other brands of low-medium and high-end lights, and none has failed due to corrosion Good service, though, Fenix, and thanks.

COMPARISONS:

THE TerraLUX TLF-300 light is quite similar in design and size , but is around 60-70% of the brightness. The TerraLUX costs only $29 -- not $55 like the Fenix LD22. It is orange; so easy to locate among other items. The Coast G32 is just as bright, though the beam is warmer compared to the Fenix cool-white. The G32 (called the 20484 on Amazon) costs is $26 and has an awesome twist focus for speeding out the beam, and it is about 10% larger than the others. IMO, Coast products rank with the high-end lights at 1/2 (or less) the cost. Both of these are 2x AA, sturdy aluminum, have reversible clips and are compact.

CONCLUSION:
The Fenix LD22 is your light if you want to stick with top, cool brands. The Coast G32 is your light if you want (what I guess is) the same quality for half the price.",the united states,"June 23, 2018",Byron Magbee,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:19:05.605126,2020-11-12 11:19:05.783296,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

73,RJWN4PE2FMXIW,True,A perfect tactical light?,"I love this light so much, that I've bought a second one. I have the prior version (which I'll compare here), and after destroying it, I had to replace it with the same light.

These things are super durable. How do you destroy one? For me, it literally took battery acid. I had my light in a box where a couple D batteries exploded and I found my light half eaten (along with other things in the box) from sitting in battery acid for who knows how long.

As a note, I was able to save the ends of the original light (the bottom button cap and the entire top light cap) and these fit perfectly on this newer version in case you want to know.

Three differences between the old and new model:
1. New model has a silver rim around the very top. The original was black and had a more rugged look. I kinda like the original look, the shiny silver makes me want to baby my light and not scratch it.
2. New model has a silver side button. The original was Grey rubber. I find the rubber switch easier to find with your finger without looking. Also, this silver button looks pretty... again, makes me want to be OCD and not scratch it.
3. The brightest setting is brighter on the 2015 model.

These things aside, this is still an awesome light. It is just big enough to. Feel sturdy, but it's not ""big"". Easily fits in a pocket or your hand. Battery life is awesome. I cycle through the brightness settings all the time. Have taken it running at night or hiking many many times. Have dropped it many many times without harm. It is reliable and light. For the price, you get a very nice product well worth the $50 bucks.

74,R21BREJGPDGZV6,True,Great light /useless sheath,"This is not my first Fenix flashlight.
I am okay with paying extra for quality because I need reliable gear , so I buy good lights.
I purchased this light because it runs on AA batteries which are easy to find , and because I wanted a smaller light for my tool bag.
The light works very well. It is bright , is reliable and the batteries last a long time on its lower settings.
The light itself is 5 stars !
However the sheath is a complete joke!
It is cheaply made , is flimsy as hell and isn't molle compatible , so I cannot attach it to molle compatible gear or my toolbag.
The belt loop on the sheath is tiny also , so don't expect it to fit a wide belt.
If I am paying big money for a light that will presumably last a lifetime then it should come with a quality sheath that is easy to use and is also built to last.

75,RYCJF2YVOJG2L,True,All things considered........,"The virtues: small and light; quite bright; durable aircraft aluminum with tail cap switch (definitely preferable to a side switch) glass lens (stay away from acrylic or polycarbonate lenses); and battery type, uses two AA batteries, preferable for many reasons to expensive short lived lithium ion cells. the downside: expensive, poor battery life; and non focusing lens which when combined with its small diameter and high lumens output makes for a harsh difficult to delineate visual experience. It is difficult to switch from the tactical to the more conventional mode which is not of real importance to me. Having said all this, this light remains one of the best I've found.

I use the lowest setting for night hiking and you keep your night vision- I don't like hiking in red light. The two medium give you more light when needed for many tasks, and the high is intense enough to see far ahead, use as a warning, scare an animal, or temporally blind a person. If you use the brightest light with the blink mode on it is disorienting to an attacker. It uses AA batteries, that means you can use rechargeable Eneloop batteries and cary an extra set easily. I do not like flashlights where you have to recharge in a special charger, though some may be brighter. I have somehow dropped this light a number of times and you would never know it, works fine.

78,R2UKM3CFAVEC7S,True,"Bright, compact, efficient and durable","I placed this flash light on my EDC backpack at easy access. Bought this light because of size, Brightness, Fenix reputation and it’s ability to use AA batteries. I have many rechargeable AA’s for other devices which have proven to be worth their weight in gold. So it made sense to look for a good EDC flashlight that would also take advantage of them. Have used this light for everything already from night highway construction work, hiking, checking low tire on a road trip, etc. One day while in the office maint guys were working between my ceiling and the roof and when entering the area I heard one worker tell the other “I wish we had a brighter light” so I walked over to the ladder and offered my Little Fenix AA flashlight. He turned it on and it was in Low mode where I keep it. I then told him how to power up through the higher outputs and the guy already in the attic was going WOW! That thing is BRIGHT to be so small. The work lights they were using were three to four times as large but not even half as bright as my small Fenix. Technology has come so far in flashlights over the past 10 years or so it is unbelievable unless you see it for yourself and these Fenix lights are at the top in my opinion.

79,R3JWVTE8OPBRV,True,Great Little AA Powered EDC Flashlight by a Reputable Company!!!,"Purchased this flashlight for back-up use in My car, work, and for home. My main two flashlights are the Nitcore P12 and Thrunite TN11S both purchased through Amazon.com I'm always receiving complements by My Co-workers about how I always have ""Cool"" flashlights. As a Jailer/Correctional Officer flashlights are an integral piece of equipment for our line of work, especial since we work 2 weeks of nightshift per work month. The Nitecore P12 uses 2 CR123 batteries or 1 1650 battery. I purchased a charger for My Orbtronic 3400mah rechargables (purchased through Amazon.com, of course). The Thrunite TN11S uses 4 CR123 batteries or 2 1650 batteries. The beauty of the Fenix LD22 is that it gives off 85% of the light of the Nitecore and Thrunite flashlights at a significantly lower operating cost since AA batteries are well abundant anywhere You go/find. This LD22 is My first Fenix brand flashlight purchase. I did consider the PD35 very closely when I bought My Nitecore P12 though. The build quality/feel of the LD22 is as expected from a company like Fenix however and I don't expect it to let Me down.

I ordered this for my husband to use at work since he is required to have one for his job.

81,R3BDP619JVJCPY,True,Excellent flashligh that could be made even better with a rubberized mode button,I have a number of Fenix flashlights and I consider the double AA configuration essential for long term emergency power outages. My only complaint with this light is the mode button. Fenix went to a stainless steel button which is great for durability but I prefer a rubberized mode button that I can easily locate by touch. It is too difficult to locate this stainless steel button by touch. You can position the belt clip in a way to help find it quickly but it's still not as good as a nice rubberized button. I am considering putting a dab of JB Weld or something on the button to help me quickly locate it. Other than this one issue the light is darn near perfect.

97,R2CXXLD9OE4OQE,True,"BRILLIANT DESIGN, BRILLIANT LIGHT!","I work as an HVAC technician, and so my job requires me to work in attics with very small parts (wires, control screws, etc.) This flashlight is perfect for me! With multiple settings, it is capable of giving me all the light I could need, from low settings for walking around to brilliantly bright for detail work. While the brightness is great, the best part in my opinion is that it runs off of standard AA batteries. If you search Amazon, you will find super-bright (600 lumen+) flashlights that use cr123a batteries. These are more capable that AA batteries, but more expensive and much harder to find (and not rechargeable). With AA's, I can easily grab a few and throw them in my bag as spares, and I could easily pick them up at any store if I run out. Fenix has a reputation as one of the better brands on the market today, and the flashlight's aluminum construction and glass lens show this quality through and through. It's even rated for impact and water resistance! A competitor to this light is the Foursevens ""Quark Click"", and was the other light I was considering buying. The reason I chose this light is that the Click only has two modes, a 3 lumen low mode or a 336 lumen high mode. This is way too much of a shift in brightness, and would possibly make you have to choose between too bright or not bright enough. The LD22 has multiple brightness settings, which seem well balanced and gradually build to the full 300 lumens. I have no regrets on buying this great light.",the united states,"June 17, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:19:18.987707,2020-11-12 11:19:19.148278,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

100,RS8IFCB064D8H,True,"Best 2 AA flashlight you can buy, but expensive","These are VERY expensive, so this is the flashlight to buy if the following are important to you:
- The BEST 2 AA battery compact flashlight you can buy
- Compact enough for a pocket, but not compact enough that I'd carry it around in my pocket just to have it on me
- Money is no object

PROS:
1. It has two switches, a tail clicky switch and a turn-style switch at the head/handle junction
2. It has 4 intensity modes, which allows you to regulate your light vs. battery life use. I.e. flashlights that are always screaming bright are less useful because you're burning batteries constantly
3. It's screaming bright when you need it to be, about as bright as you'll possibly get out of a 2 AA battery light
4. Because it takes 2 AA batteries, you can have spares on hand and the batteries are cheap, unlike lithium battery-powered lights which can be significantly brighter, but are therefore significantly more expensive to run

CONS:
1. You can't stand the light up on its tail. The clicky switch protrudes just a hair too much.
2. You can't focus the beam or unfocus it. This is a minor thing, but it could be useful in some situations.

Other things I don't care about but some may: there are no blinking modes, all buttons are mechanical (some high end lights have electronic switches), the clicky tail switch is not silent.",the united states,"August 22, 2016",meh2180,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:19:22.612552,2020-11-12 11:19:22.791075,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

113,R1RW7I6KWRK0T6,True,Excellent General Purpose AA Flashlight,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Flashlights have come a long way in the past few years and the Fenix LD22 is no exception.

AA batteries are plentiful and easily found. So, naturally a AA flashlight is a must for all. This light takes rechargeable NiMH, Lithium, and Alkaline batteries. It does NOT take a Lithium-Ion 14500 rechargeable. They will fit, but 2 will be too much voltage. I recommend using NiMH batteries for maximum runtime. Alkaline batteries also have a tendency to leak and damaging whatever device that they are in.

Operation of the light is simple and purposeful with the two separate switches. Separate switches makes helps prevent unintentional brightness changing or mode changing. The tailswitch turns the light on an off with the side switch changing brightness and modes.

The hotspot is pretty tight with a more defined edge than what I would consider normal in the transition between hotspot and spill. Makes it seem to have more of a spotlight beam, but still very usable.

I wish Fenix had made the tail switch able to stand up. The switch is too long and thus you cannot stand the light up for general illumination.

All in all, a very good light at a good price point.

149,R28W4UVHFKJ0NH,True,"Good quality flash light, previous generation better.","The previous generation was different. The center of the body had a flat portion good for mounting easily to any number of attachments. Also, the previous generation had the clip attached in the opposite direction longwise. So when you would put it in your pocket the lanyard was in your pocket and not outside of it. Also the previous generation's square rubber luminous intensity button felt higher quality.

Amazing flashlight, just wish I hadn't lost my previous generation as the new one isn't as to my liking.

Oh also the threading where the rear cap goes on feels like there is significantly less threading on the cap and body. This was no doubt to reduced costs but it feels cheaper in comparison and is more likely to get accidentally cross-threaded.",the united states,"June 26, 2016",Peter De La Cruz,3.0,0,2020-11-12 11:19:52.935547,2020-11-12 11:19:53.055227,Fenix LD22 G2 2015 EDT 300 Lumens LED Flashlight,4.6,70.56,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01418RAZY,,"#69,444 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
