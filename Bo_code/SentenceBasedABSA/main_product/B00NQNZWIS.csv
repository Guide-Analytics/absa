0,R6YSJ6FIUBJX8,True,A+ Flashlight. Excellent in Every Way,"I purchased the MT2A 2015 Edition about a year ago, and have carried and used it every day in my back left pocket. I walk a lot, commute on a bike, and work in building maintenance. I frequently use it in construction or repair situations. Not once have I had a single issue with the light. Here are the things I like most about it:

1. Operation Interface -- I can operate the light in the dark with one hand, accessing all of the different modes. It is impossible to accidentally actuate the mode selector, as in the models featuring side-buttons. The turbo mode is always instantly accessible via the turning flashlight head--this allows me to use it as a self-defense light and a utility light. (If you're unfamiliar with the MT2A's operation, a YouTube video is the best way to see how it works).

(I hate side-button operation because it is easily to accidentally change modes, which would be catastrophic in a tactical situation. It is also difficult to operate those lights quickly in the dark or in any tactical situation.)

2. Mode selection -- the modes are well-selected to balance runtime and brightness. Turbo mode is bright enough to disable an attacker at night, and somehow will still operate for two whole hours. As an emergency light, low mode is bright enough to be useful while still providing an impressively long runtime of 50 hours. I keep mine on medium and replace the batteries weekly. They never even come close to running dry.

3. Beam spread -- before this light, I was using a ThruNite Archer 2A V3. I loved the orange peel beam spread, which offered a complete gradient. At first, the tighter beam of the MT2A was difficult to adjust to. However, I grew to prefer it as it provides better throw and uses the available lumens more efficiently. The secondary beam area (spill) is still bright enough to be useful.

4. Durability. The MT2A is incredibly tough. Again, this opens the possibility of using it as a weapon (especially with the striker bezel--nice touch!). But more, I simply appreciate the security of expecting my light not to fail.

5. Price -- The MT2A is not expensive, compared to other comparable options.

6. Battery type -- though Li-Ion batteries are better-performing, I have dozens of eneloop AA cells for photography usage. I also like knowing that in a pinch, I could throw a standard alkaline or lithium cell in there in an emergency. I keep Energizer lithiums on hand just in case.

Here are my two complaints:

1. The user-selectable function, which cycles the light's mode every time the button is pressed, allows too much time (three seconds) after each button press to re-press the button and change the mode. In other words, it is too easy to accidentally change to a different mode when all you wanted to do was cycle the light on and off. One second of time would be sufficient.

This would be a deal-breaker, except that the ""Turbo"" mode is always instantly accessible by tightening the flashlight head. This way, in ""turbo"" mode, I can clear a room or perform other tactical tasks, which often require switching the flashlight off and on quickly, using the temporary-on function of the switch.

2. The beam is quite cool-colored. I like the option of a high-CRI beam, even if it must be a few lumens dimmer. (My ThruNite beam was very pleasant to use, although it may have even been too warm-colored).

I don't think there is a better AA flashlight out there, especially at this price point. AA lights will be relevant as long as that battery type remains widely used.

1,R1DFY7UNMOW5MV,True,Great torch and great price.,"Bought this for a friend in the States ( I live in England,but purchased this while over there ) as a birthday gift and when he saw it he just thought it was another plain ole torch but when he tried it he was wowed by the brightness..He has a 3 acre property and he has found it great to wander in the yard and see everything in front of him for at least 100 yds...I was impressed to so I have ordered one for myself..I actually own the XStar S1 and the Nitecore MT40 but these use the much larger batteries ,the 3.7 volt 18650,which are awkward to get if you run out of power and these torches are really used for more tactical purposes and for covering a Much larger area...This torch which runs on 2 AA's is perfect and also handy because nearly all shops sell them...You can use the Alkaline or rechargeable ones which is handy too.

It's very well made and easy to use...and this came with a belt carry case which was an extra for free...One thing to point out is this...There is a very similar one to this which is only 245 lumins...so be careful when purchasing....even on the Nitecore site it's not actually shown...This torch is also a handy size too which will fit into a pocket or even a ladies handbag...being made of aluminium is very robust and it's water proof to and comes with some spares..This torch is seriously bright and powerful for using 2xAA batteries..I doubt you'd find better..I can highly recomend this torch for the money and convienience.Cheers",the united states,"May 14, 2015",Mr. S.

2,R296O9LYCQ9BP9,True,Very pleased with the light it gives out,"Very pleased with the light it gives out, the light itself is very durable quality with bright output. Does not eat batteries at all and uses rechargeables well. Just longer than a pen and about the size of a black marker around, it is easy to carry in jacket pocket or purse. Not enough to it for a baton in protection but serves it's purpose well. The case that comes with it is good quality as all nitecore items are. The price point is high again as all nitecore items are, but also zero problems and durable and so you buy once rather than flashlight fail with the wannabees. I would buy it again but for the price I would search for a good deal or something that might be of this quality for just a bit less in cost.

4,R36DYQR60O1ZIQ,True,A fine small tactical light,"""A good tactical light can be as powerful as a shot of pepper spray on a dark night.""

Of the four tac lights I bought on Amazon recently, this one rates right up there with the USA-made Maglite Mag-Tec (I gave them each 5-star reviews). My wife and I both prefer the Mag-Tec because it's a little brighter and fits the hand so perfectly, but the advantage of this MT2A over the rechargeable Mag-Tec is that it uses two common AA batteries so you don't have to worry about it running out of charge if you keep a couple of spare batteries handy. The MT2A is very bright, and fits nicely in the hand. In the photo the MT2A is the light at far right and based on my experience is clearly superior to the SOG DE03 or the S2000 from Gearlight.",the united states,"September 23, 2018",Ethosian,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:22:09.021575,2020-11-12 15:22:09.169808,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

6,R1L99YWVJIMSLA,True,A wonderfully bright and trusty 2xAA flashlight fighting above its weight.,"This is my second MT2A. The first travels with me all over the world in my kit bag and I have been very happy to have it around when everyone else seems to only have their iphone lights. I bought this along with a Thrunight TN4A HI which is a 4xAA ""can"" type of light. This 2xAA Nitecore supposedly puts out 345 lumens and the Thrunite 1050 lumens. I have to say, and there is no scientific test behind this but my own eye, that this light is just as bright as the TN4A HI and, of course, lighter and smaller. I cannot say at this time as how it will hold up, duration of batteries (considering that I can buy 8 AA batteries for .99 cents anywhere in the US vs harder to find and more expensive 18650 battery, I'm happy to have a few extra in my pocket for a night hike) and etc. What I can say is that for the price you are getting one great bright flashlight.

Oh, and I don't give 5 stars unless whatever I'm reviewing is just off the charts. Otherwise I would need an ""our amps go to 11"" and there is no six star designation.

But what really frustrates and annoys me is that sometimes it works like a flashlight for a while. Good! Then the next time I use it all it will do is strobe. Useless. Or sometimes it works like a flashlight when I turn it on but then, all of a sudden begins to strobe. This happens a lot.
I believed that if I spent the extra $ I would get a better product. What I got was a a disappointing, annoying defect.

8,R3DGU3X1MS43XV,True,Great flashlight with one caveat...,"I've had this flashlight for just over three months. I bought a head strap so that I could use it hands free. Great light. Very bright. I like that it uses AA batteries which are easily found in emergencies. I'm using Amazon rechargeables an they work great. I use the flashlight daily for about 30 minutes, mostly on turbo. I get about 2-3 hours of use before each charge. My only gripe is that the flashlight frequently loses it's setting when I switch from turbo back to the user selected setting.

This is a good light.
I like the feature of rotating the head to go to full brightness but wish you could pic more than just one other brightness level without reprogramming the light.
Feels like good a good quality light.
I like that it is more of an area floodlight than it is a spot light. Upclose is where you would use a light like this and it lights up what you need to see without being blindingly bright.

17,RZ8FVLAZKUVA0,True,Not durable bad CS,2 nitecore s down. They can not handle impact well and the end caps have very thin walls and break at the threads. I contacted Nitecore directly for a endcap. They charged me $10 for one off a $34 light and it’s been almost 2 months and still nothing. What a joke! Also I just bought Streamlights 2AA version.

71,R3TMA9RTNBDOF3,True,This light has a propensity to choke itself to death on its own batteries.,"I loved this flashlight initially. It was solidly built, very bright, light weight, and worked well. I work as an investigator, so this light was a part of my equipment that saw regular use (though not HARD use). The problem was that after about 6 months or so of ownership, it didn't turn on one day (no indication that the batteries were dying or anything-- just here today, gone tomorrow). So I opened it up to change the batteries, and discovered that both of them had exploded and leaked corrosive acid crap all over the inside of my light. Furthermore, the batteries had swelled to the point where I couldn't extract them-- rendering the light useless.

I figured that this was my fault: I hadn't been vigilant in keeping the batteries checked and maintained. And because I liked this light so much, I ordered a second one, promising myself that I'd be much more conscientious of the replacement. Well low and behold, after approximately 4 months, the SAME EXACT thing happened. I had been keeping a close eye on the light, the batteries were not old, and were in working order, and the flashlight did not sit in some dank cellar-- it saw light use almost daily.

So long story short, if you'd like a ""survival light"" that'll last you about 4 months into the zombie apocalypse before it kills itself, choking to death on its own batteries, I'd highly recommend this. Me personally, I think I'll be going back to the beastly old mag-lights that could survive anything.",the united states,"January 21, 2017",E Yare,2.0,0,2020-11-12 15:22:42.419769,2020-11-12 15:22:42.573343,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

78,RQG42CRDKG80V,True,Best Flashlight EVER,"I did a lot of research before buying this flashlight for my son for his birthday. Holy Cow! It works insanely well! It's really light-weight, the perfect size and extremely well made.

My husband was skeptical and shook his head and claimed that I had spent too much for a little flashlight...that is until it arrived from Amazon and he turned it on. And then asked for one for Christmas. Ha!

NOTE: I did read a review luckily from another person that really helped me when I first got the flashlight. I tried to put the batteries in but they wouldn't go in all the way so I couldn't close the end. Then I remembered someone mentioning having the same issue and found that there was a wad of paper in the tube that was blocking it. It's actually a silicone packet. When I slid the batteries in, apparently it sent this little packet to the very inside end. I almost returned the flashlight, but then remembered this other reviewer's comments. So I used a small knitting needle to fish around and find it and remove it. Once I did the batteries slid in just fine. So just shake out the packet before putting your batteries in and you won't have this issue.",the united states,"December 16, 2015",Sara Ambrozich,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:22:43.389049,2020-11-12 15:22:43.518681,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

79,R3DYYZLZIWJGET,True,Great for the daily carry flashlight.,"I really like this flashlight. It's small enough to carry around, but not too small that you lose it. I've experimented with various flashlights, and finally settled on this one.
The beam is pretty even. There's a definite center ring where the light is brightest, but beyond the center ring the light doesn't just drop off, it gets gradually less bright. You cannot focus the beam, but with the way the beam is focused by default, I'm pretty happy with it. I'll try and add some pictures on the beam focus with this review.
Modes are fun to play with on a flashlight, but usually all I need is a bright beam, so I'm not huge on multiple functions. I especially don't like it when you have one button to cycle through the different modes. It's rather annoying to have to cycle through the buttons to get to the mode I need. That said, having a couple different brightness levels can be nice. If you have a light that is too bright looking into a hole you can't see anything. Enter Turbo Mode! With Turbo Mode no matter where you're at in the modes, if you need a steady light, just turn the head to the left and you've got it! Turbo Mode does not lack for brightness either! If you need something other than a steady light, you probably can take the time to cycle through your options.
The flashlight is easy to grab and hold. It fits nicely in your hand. The button is easy to press, but protected on two sides to help keep it from being turned on accidentally. It's not too fat, or too long for every day carry - and this light goes just about everywhere I go!
Battery: Two AA batteries to me is preferable to other batteries. You can find AAs pretty much anywhere for a decent price, and it doesn't hurt the size of the flashlight.
The Holster is pretty nice, though if you use it, don't pull the flap down too much or the end of the flashlight will eat through the case.
As it comes the clip is strong enough to hold the flashlight in place clipped to your pocket or something but not too strong you can't use it. Also you can move it 4 positions on the button end, & one on bulb end - great for customization but bad as if it snags on something you might lose it.
Overall it's a great every day carry flashlight! This one has been very useful for me in every day life. I have bought two so far - the second after my first one disappeared at work. I would definitely recommend this light to others.",the united states,"March 7, 2017",Luke,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:22:43.523668,2020-11-12 15:22:43.668019,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

86,R1I3R00ZBSM436,True,Seriously good AA light,I'm impressed with the performance Nitecore has managed to squeeze out of AA's! This is my first twist-to-select second function light and it's seriously useful! The stepdown between the modes are all set at a practical brightness for different environments - medium is great for eye level close inspections and the lowest setting preserves 'night vision' but is not ridiculously low like some lights. In practice the 'high' is not all that much dimmer than turbo and doubles the runtime. Best of all it's current controlled! - none of that flickering PWM signal at low brightness. While powered on I also tried a 2 foot drop and giving it several firm slams into my other palm and it didn't complain. I've collected a variety of Nitecore products and again this light has only the highest quality and attention to detail put into it. The included clip is nice and sturdy.

127,R1WNU2WJ7TGDQQ,True,Wow! Did I make the right choice....,"After trying just about all AAA battery powered flashlights, I decided to try this one. It has been the best decision I have made in product selection in quite a while. The AA battery power keeps this unit running a long time (no more replacing batteries every 2 weeks!), it puts out the light intensity based upon my needs at that moment, and it was a lot smaller than I thought. My initial hesitation to go to this product was size, since I need to carry it everywhere I go, yet when I got it, it was smaller than I expected, and it fit all my shirt pockets nicely. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried many AAA powered units and just never got full satisfaction. Of course, there are other similar products, but I tried this brand and I have been pleased with my decision and performance of this product so I highly recommend it to anyone. This is a quality product at a very modest price, and you will be pleased with it.",the united states,"March 6, 2016",Bad Dude,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:23:16.820763,2020-11-12 15:23:16.954481,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

140,RE8AI1E7G6J6E,True,Top of the line replacement for a Mini-Maglite,"I looked long and hard for a good replacement for a Mini-Maglite, and this is definitely it. I have a 2 pouch holster (one for a multi-tool, one for the Maglite) that I really like, so I needed something that was very close the the same dimensions for a good fit. My problem was that the Mini-Maglite twists the head to turn it on (annoyingly needing two hands to do so), and sometimes friction in the pouch would turn it on without me knowing, leaving it dead when I needed it. Most other push-button flashlights have an unprotected button, so sometimes this unwanted activation occurs with them too. This Nitecore is expensive, but the CREE LED bulb is the reason. If you want a very bright LED flashlight CREE bulbs are the only way to go until the next technology leap occurs, so you'll be paying more for any flashlight so equipped. The housing around the push-button solves any unwanted activation, it is very bright, and is it almost exactly the size of a Mini-Maglite. It comes with it's own holster, a spare set of ""O"" rings to keep it watertight, a wrist strap, and the pocket clip is removable if not needed. It does have the extra functions that many of the latest crop of bright flashlights have (hi-med-lo beam, SOS, strobe), but getting them going is a two handed head twist that I doubt I will use, and suspect others won't either. It will always go with hi-beam (they call it ""Turbo""mode"") first, and if not selecting any other function, will reduce power after 3 minutes as an energy saving function. Smart. This is a top of the line mini- flashlight and it completely met all of my requirements. I would say it is worth the money. I am retired military/law enforcement, and I would take the Nitecore with me on mission every time -- two of them, just to be sure).",the united states,"December 22, 2016",AJ123,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:23:30.819092,2020-11-12 15:23:30.954669,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

189,R3L839ALVR10BO,True,I would say this light is better overall. I can assure you that the lumen,"If anyone's wants to compare this to the Nitecore MT21A, I would say this light is better overall. I can assure you that the lumen, peak intensity, and beam distance ratings do not tell you the full story. This light is a wonderful AA EDC light. Love the adjustable pocket clip and the anti-roll bezel. The throw on the light is decent; you can get enough light to identify obj/ ppl at 80-90 yards. This light does not throw as far as the MT21A, but realistically this light throws only 30-40 yards shorter. This light's wider beam profile is actually closer to a throw beam than a flood beam. The light is very comfortable to carry and light weight. At 345 lumens, the light is blinding at an range under 10-20 yards. The biggest down side I see is that the run time on turbo isn't going to be longer than 20mins b/c of overheating. If your using rechargeable batteries, be careful since this light does not have low voltage warnings.",the united states,"September 3, 2016",knifecollector,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:23:56.119298,2020-11-12 15:23:56.263944,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

Comes with nylon holster, lanyard, replacement gaskets and rubber switch cover. Compact form, small diameter head is easy to carry or pack. Throws a nicely focused beam. Nitecore doesn't lie about performance; max output is available for only a short time before the flashlight automatically switches to lower output due to overheating. However, modes other than max are bright, should be sufficient for most uses and last many hours.

191,R2FVP0ECC7KSF0,True,Don't buy it. Spend a little more to get a better design.,"I bought this to replace my Fenix LD22. The specs were very similar with same LED light and rated at almost the same lumens with hi and lo selectable brightness. Overall size and shape also looked very similar and both are rugged and waterproof. When I received the MT2A I read the instructions to see how to vary the brightness. You must unscrew the forward housing a little to change the brightness. That is a very inconvenient feature since I need to change brightness levels often when inspecting with this flashlight. However, I decided to try it on the job anyway. The next problem I discovered was that the clip is incorrect for this light. There is a large gap between the clip and the body of the flashlight so that there is not grip when the light is in my pocket. The light fell out of my pants pocket several times. Big Fail. A light that falls out of my pocket is no good if I am in an attic or a crawl space. This light is a quality made product but a very poor design. I will keep it on the workbench at home but will need to order another Fenix LD22. No money was saved by buying this product.

213,R8QQ15CPABLXS,True,Switching modes could be better. But I love the light.,"I received this light yesterday and unscrewed the bottom cap, place two of my freshly charged Eneloop 2000 mAh batteries inside. I clicked it on - it was strobbing. I thought to myself it must be in user define mode - so i was twisting around the head of the light trying to get a feel for how to switch modes back to turbo or the other modes, I was hopping to feel a *click* or something but it was just a screw cap tighten and loosening. I tightened the head and the beam was solid - bright- exactly what i was looking for. The weight - felt nice to hold in my hand.

I loosen the head a little to get into the user define mode to test the high-med-low-sos-strobe. They all worked fine. you have to rapid tap the button to select through them, then hard press to select the mode you want. I gave this a 4 star and not a 5 is because of how it selects from turbo - to the user define mode - is just a twist of a head cap. If you twist the head cap enough it comes off and the batteries can come out. The batteries are accessible through the bottom cap (where the button is located too). By all means the headcap is not loose at ALL when you select to user define mode and it has a nice friction to it when you twist. But if the headcap couldn't come all the way off or if it was just a click when we/ I turned the head to select modes, i think it would ideal. But that's just my opinion in selecting modes.",the united states,"June 4, 2015",Wing Tang,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:24:12.776468,2020-11-12 15:24:12.902376,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

218,R3AS1RICBXY4GV,True,"Well balanced modes, good holsters, good product for the price range","If you need sustained light levels of over 300 lumens, do not buy this light.

If you only need the occasional brightness of 300+ lumens, this this will work.

On AA Sony Stamina Plus, starting in turbo, the light lasted about 45 minutes. With Eneloop Pro is lasted around 1.5 hours starting on turbo.
Even on alkaline batteries, if you aren't using turbo all the time, it will last a good while.

Decent spread of light levels at the different modes. Don't know why everyone feels the need to include a strobe, especially when you have momentary on; but, it's there for ya!

Included holster actually works well and is sized correctly for the MT2A. Drop tested it from waist high several times, no flicker. Dropped it in a sink of water for about 1 min. No leaks, bubbles, flickering. Pocket clip is there, though the positioning is not great.

If you need longer times of sustained high output, you can check out the Mini-Mag Pro or Pro+. Pro+ has a high of 245lumens and one lower mode. Lasts longer on high, but less output and only 2 modes (high mode only on Pro).",the united states,"June 27, 2016",Ron Schmon,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:24:13.446797,2020-11-12 15:24:13.579728,Nitecore MT2A 345 Lumens LED Flashlight w/Bonus Premium Holster - Use 2X AA Batteries,4.4,102.41,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00NQNZWIS,,"#619,527 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

For the lower modes you have to loosen the head a little then it will cycle thru each mode when you push the button. This causes you to have to do this everytime.

235,RT5XDKVC828NS,True,Went kaput after exactly a month,"Was great while it lasted ... for exactly one month. I didn't drop it or get it wet or anything - unlike a lot of folks, I actually take care of my gear. One day, it just stopped working entirely. Like a fool, I'd already tossed the box and everything else, so no warranty return option for me. Soooooo, now I'm back to using my trusty little $5 Chinese LED AA-battery light again - hasn't failed me yet in almost 4 years. This Nitecore light, though, didn't even make it past 30 days.

Swapped in several different brands of batteries, but to no avail. Totally a bummer. Up until then, however, it was an awesome little light that I used quite a bit at work. Plenty bright when you want it, or just the right amount of light if you use the lower-power setting, and it didn't chew through batteries like candy. The bonus holster it came with is okay, I suppose, but I never needed it, so it just went into a box in the closet. The pocket clip isn't terrible, but it would be a lot better if it was stronger. Had the light work itself upward and unclip itself on several occasions just from crouching or sitting down and then standing up again, but fortunately it just fell down inside of my pocket instead of dropping out entirely.

Took a chance by going with this brand that I'd never heard of before, and I guess I'll chalk this one up as a learning experience.
