0,R2BZG9GENJND7X,True,Can be modded to recess power button from turning on in the pocket.,"This is a great little flashlight, and its rechargeable but after less then a month it has already turned itself on few times inside a pocket due to keys pressing on it.
The light does have lock feature but it's not very convenient and takes a while to turn it back on.
With a bit of tinkering the light can be modded, you can build a small wall around the power button (slightly larger then the button) to prevent it from powering on by itself, I used plumbers putty epoxy stick, it may be possible to use hot glue gun, goop glue or something similar to accomplish this task.

1,RI9O8C4UC0K8J,True,Mostly good,"Bought this to replace my original version of the Tube. My first tube suddenly stopped working. the charging light would come on when plugged in but the main light would not activate. Did a look inside and found the red wire had separated from the circuit board. A quick solder job and it was almost as good as new. I found a small crack in the casing, so I have now relegated my original Tube to office desk/emergency duties and the V2.0 now rides key chain with me. The 5 additional lumens in this new Tube is not noticable over the original's output. Thank you for keeping the low setting at 1 lumen. I rarely use the adjustable output feature, using only the low and high settings.

2,R2WCHTI837B7JD,True,Lots of features for brightness level and a Power Off lock to prevent accidental turning on,"Very nice little pocket-friendly light, and the tiny keychain flashlight is a great bonus. The tube light arrives nearly full charged. The charge port has a rubber cover that is easily opened with your fingernail. The USB port is a mini-USB type, not a C type, but that's OK with me. I have several chargers that work fine.
I like to carry a pocket flashlight, and this one works great. The light has a cool feature where you can press and hold the switch button for about 3 or 4 seconds, and the light will flash once, then turn off and stay off until you hold the switch button again for 3 or 4 seconds. It takes some practice, but can be figured out.
I have owned other tiny flashlights, and inevitably I will try to use it, only to discover that the battery is dead because at some point the light had been turned on while in my pocket, so this Power Off feature is great.

3,R2CFHCUTWLO2UR,True,A part of my life now.,"This is my second. The first lasted about 2 years. (developed a loose internal connection and then wouldn't turn on again. ) I do love it BUT 1) I wish the button was recessed (raise the plastic around the button?) It gets turned on in my pocket too often. (yea this V2.0 does have the lockout but it takes effort to activate...) 2) I wish the bail in the rear, was bigger and moved a bit so it would go straight on a key ring 3) A third power level would be nice. 4) it would be WONDERFUL, if it came with some why to go hands free like a quick release ring hook and then a clip that would grab a pr of glasses on the side. To work well, the glasses clip would need to hold it forward and would need a light shield on that side so it didn't light up the glasses, or shine in eyes.

4,R1J6RCW0JF8LOV,True,Got a Bad One,"First off, I am an admitted flash light enthusiasts, and have more lights than I actually need, and just like my fellow enthusiasts that are fascinated with having ""pocket sunlight"" at their disposal, I have ones made by several companies including Nitecore. That said, I generally like the products made by Nitecore, but this time it appears that I got a bad one with the Tube. I've had it for less than a day and the on/off switch has failed, leaving it constantly on until the battery discharges. I tried different combinations of pressing the switch, slapping it to possibly free a jammed switch, and even holding it down to get it to turn off, but to no avail. And yes, I forced myself to read the instructions. I am disappointed because it is a neat little keychain light.

5,R3M2JPBHBPBWVU,True,"Good flashlight, terrible switch!","It's a great little pocket flashlight EXCEPT the power button isn't protected or shielded in any physical way from being switched on in your pocket. It's very easy to push the button and if you have anything else at all in the same pocket the light gets switched on and every time you need to use it the battery will be dead. It does have an electrical lock out that disables the power switch after you press and hold the power switch for three seconds but you only have to press and hold the switch for three more seconds to turn it back on.

6,RJ0FINCWZRLJ3,True,This thing is... incredible,"They really thought of everything. The updated version even has longer battery life AND brighter.
I generally hate multi mode flashlights you have to cycle through the modes on because.. I almost always want full bright. This flashlight makes it very easy to get to the mode you want right away, and very hard to accidentally get in the wrong mode (do people really want to flash SOS that often these days?)

Very impressed with the physical design (very rugged, the button takes just the right amount of pressure, good water protection), and the software is well thought out too. The angle of light spread is perfect for me too

7,R32UG7VWRIGUXG,True,Not as bright as the original but has longer runtime.,After having the original Tube break while in my pocket attached to my keys I was looking for another lightweight pocket keychain light but decided to try the new version 2.0.

8,R2PPSQ7H82YGCQ,True,Great Model Upgrades!,"At first I thought that the brightness was less than its predecessor but actually it's brighter but looks like less since the beam pattern is wider and more evenly spread than the older model, which has a noticeable hot spot in comparison to this model.

I am glad I purchase of two of these on June 10 2020 However, as of Sept-3-20 the Blue Colored model started blinking in a Flashing/Strobe mode. It's a pity it only lasted such a short time.
