381, i just bought this computer from the apple store  and i couldn t be more impressed with it  it has a stunning retina display  and is very fast  the solid state memory makes it a lot faster than previous macbook pro models that used a spinning hard drive  this computer is good for anything  and it has really superseded my high expectations  also  the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear  and everything is just sleek and smooth  the hd display is sensational  and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me  no hardware issues  as is common with any apple product  great product  and couldn t be happier with it ,"{'display': 1, 'memory': 1, 'drive': -1, 'experience': 1, 'product': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'MEMORY_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'HARDWARE_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'COMPANY_GENERAL': 'positive'}]"
382, meh   but cheap  i bought this so that i could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than ipad was offering  the reviews at the time in late july 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review    the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light  makes it really portable  this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus  now the graphics are not hd   and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic  medium low grade  plastic  so if you don t have kids  or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it  it should be fine  now the speed is disappointing  start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most  but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times  even for a 4gb ram it barely chugs with 3 tabs open  i tried all the window updates  this worked for a couple of hp laptops i7in that i bought later at bb  to see if it could remove the drag  it did not  really at this point i am trying to confirm if the ram can be upgraded to see if i can do that to help  couple that with lack of inbuilt bluetooth  dvd drive you are looking at a close tie  or even a loss  compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late august 2014  the hp laptops 17in  with i3 core and amd  i mentioned before from the other big electronic bb store smoked this one even before i updated windows and upped the ram  but alas they were gifts   and what is a gift if not given  all in all i wish i had waited a bit  but then again hindsight is 20 20  bought a usb dvd rw drive but have not used it yet ,"{'laptop': 1, 'for': 1, 'screen': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_PRICE': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'conflict'}, {'LAPTOP_PORTABILITY': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'GRAPHICS_QUALITY': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_QUALITY': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'negative'}, {'MEMORY_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'neutral'}, {'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'negative'}]"
383, let me start with the good so awesome  great os  fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port  this is my second macbook  the first one i had was a 2006 model  not the pro  i fell in love with it  this one has had the same effect  i had upgraded my old macbook to lion  so i kind of knew what i was getting  but hadn t been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi touch features  the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual  but substantive  the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior  the unibody construction is solid  sleek and beautiful  it is everything i d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint  but somehow a bit more sturdy  for the not so good  i got the stock screen   which is very glossy  it s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook  the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled lighting environment like me  i prefer it dark  or if you can crank up the brightness  my real problem with it  the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration    it s a lie  i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2 5 hrs out of it  the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours  enabling the battery timer is useless  the  time remaining  goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes  it s a joke  it s so bad that i m thinking i only got half a battery or something  i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like  this ain t it  my only other complaint is that it gets really hot     if you buy this   don t go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life  and you ll be perfectly satisfied ,"{'improvements': 1, 'speed': -1, 'macbook': 1, 'some': 1, 'touch': 1, 'reproduction': 1, 'it': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'OS_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'CPU_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_QUALITY': 'conflict'}, {'DISPLAY_QUALITY': 'conflict'}, {'DISPLAY_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_USABILITY': 'neutral'}, {'BATTERY_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'negative'}]"
384, i previously owned an hp desktop and a dell laptop  both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them  i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far  and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it  i especially like the backlit keyboard  it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier  it is also very lightweight  making transporting this computer very easy  the graphics on this computer are also stellar   very clear and vivid  the applications are also very easy to find and maneuver  much easier than any other computer i have ever owned  i use iphoto all the time  which is a great program for anyone who is into photography   amateurs and experts alike  the program came with the computer and works beautifully  i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this computer ever fails ,"{'graphics': 1, 'program': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'KEYBOARD_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_PORTABILITY': 'positive'}, {'GRAPHICS_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_MISCELLANEOUS': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'COMPANY_GENERAL': 'positive'}]"
385, i ve had my macbook pro since august 2009  prior to this computer  i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years  quite a long time for a laptop   that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought  my macbook pro is no exception  on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i didn t like the trackpad  since i ve had this computer i ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth  i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad  the display is incredibly bright  much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp  the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it  iphoto  imovie  iweb  itunes  garageband  is all very helpful as well  i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing  spreadsheets  and presentations  similar to microsoft office   i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well  i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality ,"{'programs': 1, 'laptop': 1, 'quality': 1}","[{'COMPANY_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'MOUSE_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'MOUSE_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_PRICE': 'neutral'}, {'LAPTOP_QUALITY': 'positive'}]"
386, great laptop from apple  apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality  the retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date  the pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface  battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display  i can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge  also  i find os x much more simple and easy to use than windows  overall  a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer ,"{'laptop': 1, 'touchpad': 1, 'navigation': 1, 'value': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'COMPANY_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'MOUSE_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'BATTERY_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'CPU_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'OS_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_PRICE': 'positive'}]"
387, i get a ton of compliments on its size  and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus  i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room  very long life battery  up to 10 11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings   i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win 7 home  and it runs just fine  i play a lot of casual games online  and the touchpad is very responsive  the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16  laptop does  i wouldn t play a first person shooter with this  mind  but if you wanted to run ms office  email  chat  download a video  listen to music from a certain fruit named music store  and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in  i d highly recommend checking this out  the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook  screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire 10 11 hours of battery life five days a week  additional caveat  the base installation comes with some toshiba specific software that may or may not be to a user s liking ,"{'size': 1, 'memory': 1, 'home': 1, 'netbook': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_PORTABILITY': 'positive'}, {'BATTERY_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_USABILITY': 'neutral'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'MOUSE_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'MOUSE_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_MISCELLANEOUS': 'positive'}, {'DISPLAY_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'negative'}, {'SOFTWARE_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'neutral'}, {'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}]"
388, the macbook is a fantastic laptop  this is the first macbook i have ever had  i came from the dell laptops and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a new laptop  the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance  although the price is higher then dell laptops  the macbooks are worth the dough  you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it  the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot  it just works flawlessly  its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action  dells are ok  hps aren t that good  but macs or fantastic  i honestly love my mac  thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict  if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications ,"{'laptop': 1, 'macbook': 1, 'reboot': -1, 'hard': 1.5, 'action': -1, 'mac': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_PORTABILITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_PRICE': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'COMPANY_GENERAL': 'positive'}]"
389, i m glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac  the benefits were immediate  awesome graphics  applications respond immediately  not like the tired ms applications   i can actually get work done with this mac  and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop  the magnetic plug in power charging power cord is great  i even put it to the test by accident   excellent innovation  the apple applications  ex iphoto  are fun  easy  and really cool to use  unlike the competition   after doing cad work all day at work  using a higher end pc  i couldn t come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer  this laptop rocks  only wish it could run solidworks cad   which apple doesn t support   i ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far  using my new macbook pro  i am definitely sold  and not going back to pcs for home use ,"{'graphics': 1, 'applications': -1, 'laptop': -1, 'innovation': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'GRAPHICS_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'POWER_SUPPLY_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_USABILITY': 'conflict'}, {'COMPANY_GENERAL': 'positive'}]"
390, i ve had this laptop for about a month now  it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part  the 2 gb of ram is plenty  able to run windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown  the ati graphics card is a huge plus  definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built in card would have trouble with  such as half life 2 or even world of warcraft  my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in  this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components  and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator  but i still expected better product quality for this price range  other than that  i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi decent gaming capabilities ,"{'value': 1, 'grounding': -1, 'quality': 1, 'this': 1, 'laptop': -1, 'capabilities': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'MEMORY_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'positive'}, {'GRAPHICS_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'PORTS_QUALITY': 'negative'}, {'HARDWARE_QUALITY': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_PRICE': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_MISCELLANEOUS': 'neutral'}]"
391, my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made  i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it  the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me  but i have just been using firefox instead  if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now  maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer  i love this computer  its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere  but still has a big enough screen to get everything done  everything is so easy to use  mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software  the only thing that i don t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to  games being the main issue  it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i can t play it because its not compatable with the software  i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be  other than that i don t have one complaint in the world ,"{'investment': 1, 'computer': 1, 'screen': 1, 'people': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_QUALITY': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'negative'}, {'DISPLAY_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_PORTABILITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'SOFTWARE_USABILITY': 'conflict'}]"
392, i have used both pcs and macs and i have to say that i really really love my mac book pro  while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at  i think there s something to be said about the simplicity of macs  everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point  love it love it love it ,"{'book': 1, 'it': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES': 'positive'}, {'OS_USABILITY': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'positive'}, {'LAPTOP_USABILITY': 'positive'}]"

394, this is without a doubt the worst laptop i ve ever had  i wavered between another toshiba and this and ended up choosing this and i m so sorry i did  and of course  the return window closed last week so now  i m stuck with it  i will never buy another lenovo anything  unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop  don t buy this  the touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning  i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i ve worked with have some inherent oddities  this one however  is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work  then suddenly  i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own  today  it hasn t worked at all more than it has  the laptop has 4g and a 2 9g processor and it s slower than the four year old toshiba i replaced  it hangs  freezes and just isn t working properly  i have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open  though i don t have much installed  i only have 96 of the 278g left  i have no idea what s taking up all the room  it doesn t make sense  most of my things are stored in the cloud  i could go on and on  but suffice it to say  if you want to spend  400  on a laptop  don t buy this one  it s definitely not worth the money ,"{'laptop': -1, 'more': 1, 'it': 1}","[{'LAPTOP_GENERAL': 'negative'}, {'COMPANY_GENERAL': 'negative'}, {'MOUSE_GENERAL': 'negative'}, {'MOUSE_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'negative'}, {'MOUSE_QUALITY': 'negative'}, {'MOUSE_USABILITY': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_MISCELLANEOUS': 'negative'}, {'LAPTOP_PRICE': 'negative'}]"
