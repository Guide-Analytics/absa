0,this thing lights up the night sky! bought it for dog walks and hone security. it does more than the trick. everyone who sees it in action either laughs or is shocked.,,,,,this thing lights up the night sky!,
1,"I own three Streamlight weapon-mounted lights, as well as a Streamlight Super Tac handheld flashlight. I bought this because I needed a rechargeable light to carry on my dark morning runs in the Winter. This light looks and feels very well made. A side-by-side comparison against my other lights shows that this one is far brighter than them all. I consider this flashlight to be a good size and weight, even for my runs (I prefer a handheld light instead of a headlamp). The center of the beam is extremely bright and far reaching, and the spillover of the beam provides ample lighting to the sides of the road. I like the three intensity settings and the strobe feature, although I wish there was a very low setting for the brightness (even the lowest setting is blindingly bright). Additionally, the charger is very nice, and comes with an extra battery and a separate charging station for that extra battery. I couldn't be happier with this product. I'll be buying at least two more of these now that I've proven how great this light is.","I consider this flashlight to be a good size and weight, even for my runs (I prefer a handheld light instead of a headlamp).","I own three Streamlight weapon-mounted lights, as well as a Streamlight Super Tac handheld flashlight.This light looks and feels very well made.","I bought this because I needed a rechargeable light to carry on my dark morning runs in the Winter.Additionally, the charger is very nice, and comes with an extra battery and a separate charging station for that extra battery.","I like the three intensity settings and the strobe feature, although I wish there was a very low setting for the brightness (even the lowest setting is blindingly bright).","I own three Streamlight weapon-mounted lights, as well as a Streamlight Super Tac handheld flashlight.A side-by-side comparison against my other lights shows that this one is far brighter than them all.The center of the beam is extremely bright and far reaching, and the spillover of the beam provides ample lighting to the sides of the road.I like the three intensity settings and the strobe feature, although I wish there was a very low setting for the brightness (even the lowest setting is blindingly bright).",
2,"Great flashlight that is bright and lasts! First, I want to say that I own two of these! One is my personal one that I keep at the house and the other was issued to me by my Police Department. After being issued one of these and using it on the street, I bought one for myself at the house in case we needed it. It has three settings of power. One is very bright, middle, and low light. Depending on which you use, will depend on your battery life. The best thing about these lights are that they are rechargeable with an adapter that comes with it, which is very easy to use. I've had my flash lights for about 3 years now and feel 'naked' when I forget it in the car, that's how dependable I am of it! As far as quality and durability, it has a solid metal feel to it (not plastic at all). It's well balanced in the hand, and not to heavy, but not too light either.. I can usually go on a full charge for about a week or two, depending on how often I am using it. Plus I have a SureFire light for my belt, so sometimes I alternate between flashlights. But this is my go-to light when I need to locate something or blind the crap out of you (especially in strobe setting)! I highly recommend this light to anyone, you will not be displeased!","It's well balanced in the hand, and not to heavy, but not too light either..","As far as quality and durability, it has a solid metal feel to it (not plastic at all).It's well balanced in the hand, and not to heavy, but not too light either..","Depending on which you use, will depend on your battery life.The best thing about these lights are that they are rechargeable with an adapter that comes with it, which is very easy to use.I can usually go on a full charge for about a week or two, depending on how often I am using it.",It has three settings of power.But this is my go-to light when I need to locate something or blind the crap out of you (especially in strobe setting)!,"Great flashlight that is bright and lasts!It has three settings of power.One is very bright, middle, and low light.The best thing about these lights are that they are rechargeable with an adapter that comes with it, which is very easy to use.I've had my flash lights for about 3 years now and feel 'naked' when I forget it in the car, that's how dependable I am of it!As far as quality and durability, it has a solid metal feel to it (not plastic at all).",
3,"I bought mine back in 2012 with the piggyback charger. It is so bright that while testing it out the first night, shining down my dark street, an irate neighbor came stomping over complaining about it. LOL

I've used it out in the mountains at night for walking my dog, and it is amazing. Normally the highest setting is too bright to look at when shining at the ground. Piggyback charge is very nice, and of course the extra battery. I've never run the battery down, even on long hikes, but I do rotate them periodically to prolong life.

The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that bezel needs be hexagonal like a nut, so it won't accidentally roll off the counter or the like.",,,"Piggyback charge is very nice, and of course the extra battery.I've never run the battery down, even on long hikes, but I do rotate them periodically to prolong life.","Normally the highest setting is too bright to look at when shining at the ground.I've never run the battery down, even on long hikes, but I do rotate them periodically to prolong life.The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that bezel needs be hexagonal like a nut, so it won't accidentally roll off the counter or the like.","It is so bright that while testing it out the first night, shining down my dark street, an irate neighbor came stomping over complaining about it.Normally the highest setting is too bright to look at when shining at the ground.",
4,"I do home inspections and use my flashlight 5-6 days a week. I have used Maglights, Pelican and the Streamlights with a xenon bulb. This is the best flashlight I have ever owned!

The bright white light from the LED bulb is incredible, to say the least. I was blown away the first time I saw it. In attics and crawlspaces the light beam goes all the way to the other side.

For this particular model, I also love that it has two switches, the normal switch location near the bulb and the tail switch. You can use either one at any time.

If you have the comparable Streamlight Stinger with the xenon bulb, you can use the same charger, you don't need to buy another charger.

I absolutely love this flashlight! (I'm a home inspector, I get excited about about my ""toys/tools"")",,,,"For this particular model, I also love that it has two switches, the normal switch location near the bulb and the tail switch.","The bright white light from the LED bulb is incredible, to say the least.In attics and crawlspaces the light beam goes all the way to the other side.",
5,"I have been using stream light flashlights for years. Being a police officer, I learned to respect the quality of stream light flashlights. I’ve used an HP and regular stinger rechargeable flashlight, From being used in harsh environments and being dropped during a confrontation, they always came back on when needed. When selecting replacement for my lost flashlight, I checked Streamlight website to make sure I had the right part number to order with a smart charger. When I receive this part number was right but it did not come with a smart charger. So beware if you are looking for her unit with a smart charger. I will be contacting stream light tomorrow to find out how this could be a mistake in their literature.",,"Being a police officer, I learned to respect the quality of stream light flashlights.","I’ve used an HP and regular stinger rechargeable flashlight, From being used in harsh environments and being dropped during a confrontation, they always came back on when needed.",,,
6,Stream light is a fantastic flashlight! Worth every single penny! It can illuminate way farther and brighter than any other flashlight. We already have about three of them and my husband always likes coming for more. The quality of a stream light will make you throw all your other flashlights away. The battery life is great on it too. My husband can have it not charged for months using it as needed and it goes strong.

7,"Streamlights are very high quality products, and this one is no exception. The Stinger DS LED HP seems about twice as bright as my older incandescent Stinger HP, and the battery charge is supposed to last twice as long. The deep reflector produces an intense focused beam that really reaches out (~150 Yards), but still has adequate spill for seeing close up. And like all metal Stingers the construction is just about bullet proof. Barrel diameter is 30mm which enables mounting on your long survival tool with a wide variety of mounts. Don't waste your time and money on small lights that don't throw a focused beam.",Don't waste your time and money on small lights that don't throw a focused beam.,"Streamlights are very high quality products, and this one is no exception.And like all metal Stingers the construction is just about bullet proof.","The Stinger DS LED HP seems about twice as bright as my older incandescent Stinger HP, and the battery charge is supposed to last twice as long.",,"The Stinger DS LED HP seems about twice as bright as my older incandescent Stinger HP, and the battery charge is supposed to last twice as long.The deep reflector produces an intense focused beam that really reaches out (~150 Yards), but still has adequate spill for seeing close up.Don't waste your time and money on small lights that don't throw a focused beam.",Don't waste your time and money on small lights that don't throw a focused beam.
8,"I am on my second light, they are amazing I guess is how to describe them. I lost my first one by leaving it on a plane I worked on. (Im an aircraft mechanic). They are really bright, I can see the top of the tail on a A330 or B767 no problem. They have 3 modes of dim to superbright. The two buttons are nice, one on the side, thats the one I use and the one in the back. I just dont use that one that often but its good to have. The battery last very long, and rechargable. I can probably have it on all day at work, I do 10 hr shifts. The best part of this, is the durability. The thing is unbreakable. I have dropped it from 20 ft and no problem pick it up and it works like new. I have many knicks dings and scratches, but the thing works great still! Its worth every penny!

CONS:
I think the button on the side tends to come out so you have to basically take it all apart to put it back in the correct position. Other then that there is no cons about this light.

Recommend:
Anyone that needs a flashlight that is super bright super durable and super reliable.

10,"I try not to buy too much for work but the stuff they give us aren't always the best. However, I work midnight hours so I need a reliable and a great flashlight. When I bought this, I read the reviews and it had good ones, just like hundreds of those out there. What got me about this one is the distance of the light. It projects, farther than any flashlight in similar size as this one. Now, you can buy handheld spotlights which work great, but this is just as good and about a tenth of the weight and size. I usually charge it once per night and last about 3 to 3.5 hours of continuous use for me on high.. even though its rated about 2.5 hrs on high. The distance will go through a football field with good visibility lighting. overall, a great use of 115 bucks and definitely work it.","It projects, farther than any flashlight in similar size as this one.Now, you can buy handheld spotlights which work great, but this is just as good and about a tenth of the weight and size.",,"However, I work midnight hours so I need a reliable and a great flashlight.I usually charge it once per night and last about 3 to 3.5 hours of continuous use for me on high.. even though its rated about 2.5 hrs on high.",,"What got me about this one is the distance of the light.It projects, farther than any flashlight in similar size as this one.The distance will go through a football field with good visibility lighting.",
