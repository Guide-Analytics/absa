    "\n",
    "_“J2” got their name from the first initials of their founders, John and Jim. As brothers, the company was founded in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2004. Our very first product was the Nuwai TM303x which turned out to be a “hot seller” amongst flashlight enthusiasts. Small, bright and compact, gadget lovers fell in love with this awesome, tactical flashlight as we all became “flashaholics” (in a good way of course)._\n",
    "\n",
    "From J2's Google Reviews, this store is seen by enthusiasts as highly knowledgeable, with vast selection, and strong customer service.\n",
