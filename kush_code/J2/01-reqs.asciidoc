== Profile: J2 LED Flashlight

_``J2'' got their name from the first initials of their founders, John
and Jim. As brothers, the company was founded in Toronto, Ontario,
Canada in 2004. Our very first product was the Nuwai TM303x which turned
out to be a ``hot seller'' amongst flashlight enthusiasts. Small, bright
and compact, gadget lovers fell in love with this awesome, tactical
flashlight as we all became ``flashaholics'' (in a good way of course)._

From J2’s Google Reviews, this store is seen by enthusiasts as highly
knowledgeable, with vast selection, and strong customer service.

== Business Objective, Strategic Fit

* Our goal is to demonstrate Guide Analytics product capability to J2
and further understand their business needs. +
* Last engagement was `2020-11-05`, meeting notes recorded
https://guideanalytics.slack.com/archives/CUTJZDEFN/p1604619210005600[here].

Given J2 has a large product catalogue, they could benefit from
comparisons of product specifications, aspect-based sentiment summaries
of product reviews, and using our data on top of existing sales and
inventory records to drive growth.

*Advertising Strategy*

* How might our tools inform their advertising strategy? How does our
aggregate data drive decisions to change J2’s website, promotions,
creative copy, target segments, a/b experiments? How might J2 can
increase their brand awareness and sales?

They are working with https://digitalmainstreet.ca/[Digital Main Street]
and we would like to listen in and explore further.

* We want to get the learnings from quality reviews that would help J2
sell products to consumer for everyday carry, hunting, camping use
cases, as well as get contracts with camp sites, business military and
law enforcement.
