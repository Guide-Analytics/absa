0,R2IJWNWHE3UHWA,True,Perfect tactical floodlight,"The tint in the spill portion of the beam is slightly cool and the very large hotspot is close to neutral white. As a result of the hotspot’s tint, the color rendering is excellent, I’m not saying it qualifies as high CRI, but it’s close. The LEDs glow for about 30 seconds after use, which looks beautiful. The “ultra-low” 30 lumens output is surprisingly useful, not just for tasks right in front of your face, but genuinely useful out to 10 meters. Ultra-low, low, mid, and arguably high, are all for your immediate area (high is useful out to about 70 meters max... ANSI specs always fall short of real world usefulness). Turbo, although brief (7 seconds) is for sure — 100% amaz-balls out to 100 meters. The tm9k is pretty head heavy — it feels like there is a sizable ring of copper being used as a heat sink. The combination of the weight with the fierce (almost knife edge) strike bezel and the 9500 lumen burst, makes this torch perfect for tactical applications.

*side-note: a usb c wall adapter is necessary to achieve quick charging. Not trying to be a sales person but the lumen tac wall charger is the cheapest one I could find and works as expected.
