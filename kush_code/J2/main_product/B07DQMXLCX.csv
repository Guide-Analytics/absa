2,R47F6Q9TB1GLC,True,Get Lit!!,"I'm a Torch Junkie. Lets just start there. I'm also a bit of a torch snob as well as a torch collector who still has his first Mag Lite from 1981. Nitecore is and has been a very reputable company, so when I learned of the Nitecore TIP series from a friend, I couldn't resist and I'm glad I didn't! I own the Nitecore Thor. A Classic among Nitecore torches I think any collector would agree. That is a foreboding and powerful torch with its 900 lumens of dependable light. When I saw that this little key chain torch packed 700 lumens, I wasn't really surprised, because we've come a long way since Thor was introduced. But I was in the market for a budget friendly compact torch. With its intelligent interface to the dual beam emitters to the hard anodized aluminum body, this light means business. Tough, capable, versatile, compact, bright when you need it, subdued when you don't. The 700 lumen turbo mode would light the way to hell and the ease of use and intuitive mode selection makes this the perfect all around torch for Every Day Carry, a Key Chain, or an emergency torch for your Bug Out Bag with a battery that holds its charge for a FULL YEAR! Lest we not forget, the interface also allows you to check the battery condition at any time, set a 30 second time limit or disable this feature and 4 total brightness modes with memory for the three standard modes. Turbo can be accessed while in any mode or when needed quickly with a simple press of the mode button for momentary or full on with a 3 second hold of the mode button. Now for the not so good. It's minor, so don't run off just yet! The pocket clip leaves a bit to be desired. It does a great job of keeping the USB-C protected and keeping the buttons covered to help quell accidental powering on. But as a pocket clip, it falls on its face. So, if you're thinking ""Wow!! I can just clip this on my Backpack or in my Pocket....think again. It's best kept safe IN your pocket or securely attached to your backpack with a carbiner. But that's the ONLY Con to this awesome Torch. So....you've got very little to loose! At the time of this review, the TIP SE is listed at $29.95. How can you go wrong? By buying another Subpar Torch! That's How!

3,RXCKDHD4A3EJ4,True,This unit has every feature required for a superb EDC flashlight,"I have been carrying Nitecore Tube flashlights for my EDC flashlight for the last 3 years. But I have gone through 3 of them in the last 3 years as the result of switch failures. I decided that I was not going to replace another one, so my search for a new EDC flashlight began. I took a look at the specs on this Nitecore Tip SE and decided to give it a shot. Let me say - I am blown away on how perfect this little light is for my daily EDC use. It's like it was custom designed for the way I use it. First of all, it's tiny. It's bigger than my Nitecore Tube but not by a whole lot. And like my Nitecore Tube, I can easily find the on/off switch almost immediately when I reach into my pocket to pull the light out. The small rubber on/off and mode buttons are easy to feel and use without having to look for them, and the UI (user interface) is very simple and easy to remember. You turn it on with the simple click of one button and you cycle through the modes with the other button. The battery is a 500-milliamp battery which means you get a nice long run time. Some other competing products have great specs but little 100-200-milliamp batteries with short run times. The range of brightness levels is also very good on this unit. You get 1, 30, 180, and 700-lumen outputs. You can go a full one hour 30 minutes at 180 lumens and that kind of output is great for just about anything you might need to do whether it be indoors or outdoors. This impressive little flashlight has become my new EDC flashlight.",the united states,"August 27, 2020",Squanto McGee,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:09.740277,2020-11-12 14:37:09.974309,Nitecore Tip SE Black 700 Lumen USB-C Rechargeable EDC Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Keychain Light,4.7,89.74,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07DQMXLCX,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Enwum2jHL._AC_SY355_.jpg
4,R2HVRN6LIPTXGU,True,The direct access to the Low and Turbo modes are my personal favorites.,"NiteCore steps up their game and upgrades the original TIP into a Blazing Beast! 700 Lumen output on your keychain, Very Nice :) The light gives you many options, the direct access to the Low and Turbo modes is one of my favorites. This light is in the premium price category for it's size, can this small powerhouse hold up to the many choices facing the consumer? Let the SE show us how it's done ;)

Features I like about this Flashlight:
Dual OSRAM P8 LEDs for a Seven Hundred Lumen Output.
Thirty Lumen Medium Mode for Eight Hours.
Direct Access to Low and Turbo.
Type C charging port.
Rugged Build, with 66lb. rated attachment point.
One Lumen Low Mode for Fifty Hours.
500mAh Lithium Battery, with a one year standby mode.
Momentary Access to Turbo and Low Modes.
Under an Ounce in Weight.
Remember last Setting.
IP56 Water Resistance.
ATR: Advanced Temperature Regulation.
TIR Optics for a smooth beam.
Includes a Snap On Metal Clip to easily attach it to your keyring.
Belt/Hat Clip.
One Hundred and Eighty Lumen High for One and a Half Hours.
Battery Status/Charging LED indicator.

Features that could be added or improved on:
Include Charging Cable.
A Lockout Feature like the Original.
A High CRI version.

Overall, this is a fantastic flashlight that deserves your attention. The Fenix E03R offers great flexibility, but not the 700 Lumen intensity, and higher capacity that this TIP SE Monster provides.",the united states,"September 30, 2020",Todderbert,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:09.989464,2020-11-12 14:37:10.334431,Nitecore Tip SE Black 700 Lumen USB-C Rechargeable EDC Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Keychain Light,4.7,89.74,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07DQMXLCX,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Enwum2jHL._AC_SY355_.jpg
5,RYTWL878PZZGE,True,"Best EDC flashlight, period.","First I confess I am a flashlight nut. I have dozens of flashlights ranging from tiny 1-inch keychain lights to spotlights that will probably light up France from the the shores of England, and most sizes in between. I don't mind paying a bit more as long as the flashlight is high quality. Recently my old Nitecore keychain light died after about 8 years of faithful service. After looking at products and reviews for a long time, I settled on this.

Wow! What a tiny but fantastic powerhouse. This USB rechargeable light fits nicely on my keychain, and is in fact shorter, narrower and lighter than my car's remote key fob. We don't have car keys anymore. We all have remote key fobs. Most of these are similar in size and weight, so when I say this thing is lighter and smaller than the key fob, you know how small it is. The product description says it puts out 300 lumens on high, and 700 on turbo. I was a bit skeptical. I've seen lots of claims of lumens that were exaggerated. I turned it on, and cycled through low, medium and high. Low gave enough light to see your way in, say, a totally dark garage. Medium was bright enough to light up my fairly large garage so I could see everything. If I had to change a tire, I think I could do it with the medium setting, which is comfortably bright. The high setting lit up the whole space. 300 lumens? Yeah, I can believe it. In fact I own several 300-500 lumen hand held flashlights, and the light from the high setting measured up. My hand-held flashlights are 5-7 inch long and uses the latest LED technology! How did this little 2 inch, flat bodied key chain light manage to match them?? Next I held my breath and held down the button to the Turbo setting. Holy Solar Flare, Batman! My whole garage lit up like I had turned on a work light. It was BRIGHT!!
i am sure that the battery won't last super long on turbo. One reviewer said a bit over half an hour? But it was insane to have a key chain light, one that is so small, put out that amount of unbelievably lumens. If you like flashlights, if you want to have a light handy all the time that could light up the world, get this one!

Just a last word about this. My hand held flashlights all have variable focus. The few that don't, tend to put out a narrow beam that is like a light saber. I have no problem with this. In fact I love standing out in the dark and playing my light beams on distant trees and hillsides. The light from THIS little monster is non-adjustable, and it is relatively wide focus. So if you really wanted to change a tire or whatever, it does light up a wide area so you can work. But you can't narrow focus it. Not a big deal for me, just something you should know before buying.",the united states,"October 31, 2020",Iron,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:37:10.335430,2020-11-12 14:37:10.618684,Nitecore Tip SE Black 700 Lumen USB-C Rechargeable EDC Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac Keychain Light,4.7,89.74,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07DQMXLCX,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Enwum2jHL._AC_SY355_.jpg
6,R1XWQEZR59X7LB,True,Great little light,"I have found this light to be a great addition to my rather large collection of flashlights. It's very easy to use (unlike some where you have to remember a special order of pushing or holding buttons to change settings). When I first got it, it was somehow in the battery-saving mode and the light would turn off after about thirty seconds. It was a simple matter to change that. I often use it clipped to the bill of my cap for a headlight. It's easy to use the buttons even on my cap.

7,R387H0WCQ96KAT,True,This isn't your Father's keychain lite!,"I need a good keychain light as i often make deliveries after dark and I hate carrying a large flashlight. This little light does the trick. It has 4 light modes, dim, medium, high, and turbo (super high), In most cases the medium will work, but having the two extra light capabilities is a great feature. in the 'bright' mode it gives off more light than my old MiniMag. In Turbo, it comes close to my old 4-cell MagLight. The buttons require a bit of pressure to activate the light so it shouldn't be going off in your pocket. When turning it on, it will come on at the last setting used, or you can go to instant turbo, or dim. Another great thing is the rechargeable battery via any usb-c cable. The price is a tad on the expensive side, but you'll more than make up for that in battery cost savings and its utility.

8,R3AETA2HRBA7PH,True,Literally everything I want in a flashlight.,"I love this light! I had the older model for a couple years before losing it! But it still worked perfectly and had a long battery life.
This one doesn't seem much brighter, despite having more lumens.

The brightest level actually produces enough heat that I've burned holes in the pocket lining of my pants when it accidentally turned on. Then I learned to face the buttons towards my skin, instead of outwards. That way nothing can push the buttons.

The greatest benefits of this light are:

You can go straight to the dimmest and brightest levels without toggling through all the levels.
The dimmest one is really dark so you don't destroy your night vision.
The brightest is shockingly bright for it's size.
It's super small.
They're super durable. My last one was a plastic body (this is metal) and all lasted years of being in my pocket every year.

The rectangle design makes perfect for holding in your teeth/lips for quick hands free use. Much more comfortable than a round one.",the united states,"October 28, 2020",M.

9,RJX4KVLCW4MIS,True,My new home EDC,"I love this light. I keep it in my pocket at home around the house and when not working. I have a Fenix 3,000 lumen light I use at work - way too bright for around the house. As mentioned, it fits very comfortably in a pocket.

This light is just right with its four brightness levels. I use it a lot and have only had to charge it twice so far, so it has great battery life.

The light doesn’t have any crazy flashing modes or anything else that is essentially useless around the house, which I really like. You get low, medium, and high modes. There’s a turbo mode too if you need the full 700 lumens, which I find I rarely need. The interface is great too, a simple on/off button and a brightness button.

You can also check the battery level by one quick press of the brightness button when the light is off. Again, quick and easy to use.

Compared to other lights, this will give you the biggest bang for the buck and a great light that you will use every day.

10,R1BAJVV0HBK74P,True,Amazingly bright and tiny.,"I was kind of expecting this to be a big and bulky key chain light, but it's surprisingly small. For its size it is also amazingly bright. It's like a spot light. I'm able to clearly see objects 50 yards or more in the dead of night. I also like that I am able to attach it to the brim of my hat. It's so small and light I don't even notice it's there. My only complaints are that it didn't come with a power cable, and, as with all Nitecore flashlights, cycling thru the lamp modes can be confusing, especially when you need light in a hurry.
