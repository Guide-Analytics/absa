0,R1QR897QAX0R1,True,"Nice light, but has some quirks. Flashoholics may not love it.","This is a pure flood light. Don't expect it to throw too far. It has a really wide, pretty much perfect beam. The sheer of light the light puts out especially on the 2 highest settings is crazy. It's a different animal all together. There's no beam imperfections. You'd never ever be able to tell that it's got 4 LEDs as far as beam quality is concerned.... Nitecore has put this light sortof in the background. Even the NM series is kinda vague on the description of the purposes of them. Of course, it's got a internal battery (a great one) and can't be removed. USB micro rechargeable (wish it was USB type C). Switch is nice. It's kinda wierd compared to most rear switch lights, since it's off center.... Feeling Wise it's kinda different. Worst thing about it is this - there is no ""fast on"" or ""instant on"". So it's not tactical in a sense. You have to press and hold the button for 3 seconds to get into turbo mode.... 3 seconds to turbo. Otherwise it starts on low everytime you turn the light on. Once it's on, since it has no separate button for levels and modes, the power switch does all of it. To turn off you hold the power button for 1 second. There's a reason it's not super expensive. It is a general purpose EDC light with some influence from the Tiny monster series. Period. It's a quality light for sure...",the united states,"February 26, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:06:12.001708,2020-11-12 15:06:12.234589,NITECORE NM02 2700 Lumen USB Rechargeable Flashlight and LumenTac Keychain Light,4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B081SBLQZD,"{'manufacturer': 'NITECORE', 'part number': 'NM02+KEY', 'product dimensions': '12.34 x 3.4 x 2.84 cm; 172.37 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.

1,R3FZZL2H0AHS24,True,Best flood beam !,"This is a very high quality light, I have several other Nitecore lights and they are all amazing. This light has the largest flood I have seen in a light this small. The flood is smooth with absolutely no multi lens lines or distortion. The five brightness levels are spaced out well, some lights preset levels are too bright. The highest level of light will throw a smooth beam over my entire backyard which is about an acre.

2,R2QYP36VVAPVAU,True,This is NOT a flashlight that throws a beam.,"Extremely high quality light but this is an area light, not a spotlight. It is very bright and it gets hot to the touch in a matter of seconds being on turbo (could be used to thaw locks in the winter), but this does not light up anything at distance. My master bedroom is 20'x25' and it will fill the entire room with bright light. Take it outside in total darkness and anything beyond 25 yards is barely lit up. I like the light, as it is probably one of the better built lights out of the dozen of brands that I have, but the beam (I use that term lightly, no pun intended) is a little more diffused than I would like. Still it fits a niche that was missing from my lighting arsenal.",the united states,"August 17, 2020",Paul B.,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:06:12.474359,2020-11-12 15:06:12.712036,NITECORE NM02 2700 Lumen USB Rechargeable Flashlight and LumenTac Keychain Light,4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B081SBLQZD,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cVjjqzmML._AC_SY355_.jpg
3,R39HSZS8J6ROWO,True,Perfect Flashlight for Serious Mechanics,Hey guys and gals I’m a career master mechanic and flashlights are very important to us. This model is perfect for what mechanics need. It’s true the about the low distance but this tactical light lights up my work space extremely well and I highly recommend it. Not to mention it is waterproof NOT resistant. The charging port is sealed as well. Great engineering. Perfect range for the light setting almost like a rheostat so you can choose your brightness. As far as the turbo mode honestly its too bright for most of my needs but its nice to know its there if i need it in an emergency. I’ll wrap it up by saying buy this flashlight its well worth it. Thank You Nitecore job well done!

4,RSVFCRWSRSA7O,True,Great UI,"The NM02 is a great edc, car, or around the house light. It has a simple UI that always starts on ultra low (press and hold to turn on) then click the button to cycle through all brightness levels. There is direct access to turbo from off — press and hold for 3-4 seconds (not tactical at all but it is useful). High — 1250 lumens runs constant and without any excessive heat. Turbo — 2700 lumens runs for only a couple of minutes then steps down to high, but it gets uncomfortable to hold at the 1 minute mark. High is the way to go since the jump in perceived brightness from high to turbo doesn’t seem very extreme to my eyes, but the difference in heat generation and battery usage is extreme. The charging seems pretty fast and the battery can support 2700 lumens until it’s almost depleted.",the united states,"June 27, 2020",D,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:06:12.953917,2020-11-12 15:06:13.154130,NITECORE NM02 2700 Lumen USB Rechargeable Flashlight and LumenTac Keychain Light,4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B081SBLQZD,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cVjjqzmML._AC_SY355_.jpg
5,R3BBZZ1JZOZP3P,True,Good output but more flood than focused,"I wanted to like this light more. I had the NM01 (1000lm) and really liked it. It got lost so I upgraded to this NM02 with 2700lm. Unfortunately, this model uses 4 LED’s to get those lumen numbers and looses its ability to provide a focused center beam. This didn’t serve my needs well. Luckily I found my NM01.

6,R2CUDM9B0H34BE,True,Had problems but works now!,"I bought this flashlight and used it for about 10 days and it stopped working! I never dropped it or damaged it. The light indicates that it is charging however it doesn’t charge at all. Very disappointed. Now I am unable to perform my nightly duties until I receive a new one. Also this is my second one.
EDIT: I could not turn on the light however i think its a little glitch that may happen. If this happens hold the power button while connecting it to power and keep it held until the light turns on.
