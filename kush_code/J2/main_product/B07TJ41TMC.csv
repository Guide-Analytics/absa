I use it daily for my work and it is always with me...for such a small light it is a very effective and powerful. I like the rechargeable feature ...I top it off about once a week with daily use.

5,R3NEYWO5K1U9A7,False,"Awesome light, great company, fantastic battery life","I bought this light at a trade show earlier this year. It's my third Fenix light, different models in the past. All fantastic lights. This 5000 battery has excellent life between charges, providing you don't have it on level 5 all the time. The holder is a little snug as it's the same size as my PD35, but the body on the 36 is a bit larger. Although mine has a little ""Glitch"" every now and then, I haven't sent it back for warranty cuz I just love this light and don't want to be without it! Haha. (Every now and then it doesn't work, no light. So I unscrew the back, thighten it back up and it works, not a big deal, but a little annoying).

7,R1T1FDKDCX569N,True,"Simply De-light-ful, but be warned","I purchased this flashlight because I saw the outstanding performance from other Fenix products my father owns and from the lasting shame and disappointment that comes with realizing a 3 D-cell LED Mag-Lite just isn't all that bright. I love this light.

The night it arrived, I plugged it in and waited patiently for it to charge so I could use it for my late night walk with the dog. When the charge indicator finally held green, I pulled out the charging cable, leashed the dog, and went out to test my new light source. Coming from a collection of LED Mag-Lites, nothing could have prepared me for the next few moments.

When I first switched the light on, it defaulted to the Eco intensity; this is roughly as bright as an LED 2 A-cell Mag-Lite. This is a good starting point, but this is an expensive light and, to quote Jeremy Clarkson, ""WE NEEEEED MOOOORE POWWWWUHHHHH,"" so I tapped the side button to go up to Low.

At Low, we're basically at the LED 2 or 3 D-cell Mag-Lite brightness, but in a beautiful, beam of light. I can feel the power I must be holding and I'm not sure if I am qualified to operate it, but there are three remaining levels and, being a man of science and culture, my domesticated dog-walking experiment must continue, so I bumped the intensity to Medium.

At Medium, the torch is throwing enough light that I'm beginning to question whether a 1600 lumen output could be the sort of thing that might require a permit or license to operate, but I'm unwaivered: I have to know how bright this is, so I tap the setting button up to High.

On High, the darkness ahead of me retreats back far enough that, though it was 10:30 PM, I thought the sun may be rising. I could clearly see details in the woods behind the house that I had previously seen only during daylight hours and I began to realize I may be disturbing woodland creatures and even neighbors as I shine this gorgeous light at everything around me like I would normally do with the far inferior lights I owned up until that night. In my excitement and amazement at the light this tiny device could produce, I nearly forgot about the Turbo setting, so in fear and awe, I tapped the button to go all the way to Turbo mode.

The light was blinding. It provided such illumination and clarity over a distance that, as I stared out into the world once covered in darkness, but now lit as if the sun had risen, I could glimpse past, present, and future. All the life events that brought me to this brilliant moment in time were simultaneously visible with the things that had not yet come and the wonderful high intensity flashlight experiences the future will hold.

The dog finished her business and I realized the flashlight had bonded a twig on the pavement to the cement at a molecular level. Nearby roosters stopped crowing because their work was done. Stars were no longer visible in the night sky from the light pollution emitting from this incredible device. As I walked back to the house, I realized the magnitude of what had just happened: while the rest of the world will continue to measure years of time as Before the Common Era (BCE) and Common Era (CE), I must hereto measure time as Before Fenix Flashlight (BFF) and Fenix Flashlight (FF).

Don't look for other products, just buy this. Buy ten of them and strap them together if you need to replace a lighthouse, a star, the light from an arc welder, or perhaps some sort of research-grade lighting apparatus used to test light absorption of materials like Vanta-Black or Black 2.0. This is the best possible lighting experience you can get for the money and if, like me, you are one of those poor fools who thought an LED Mag-Lite was bright, you can join the Brotherhood of Bright, Flashy Things and spread the gospel of Fenix lights and what it means to send darkness fleeing.",the united states,"November 29, 2019",Paul,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:02:05.761053,2020-10-27 22:02:05.886717,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen USB rechargeable CREE LED tactical Flashlight with EdisonBright charging cable carry case bundle,4.7,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TJ41TMC,,"#55,985 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

10,RCCTWS3KZEL85,True,Flashlight is great. Almost worthless bundle.,"The Fenix PD36R is a great flashlight. It gets five stars. The bundle is worthless. Sure, you get an official ""EdisonBright charging cable carry case bundle"" (aka a short usb-c cable of questionable vintage and a cheap plastic case). I suppose you can store the magnificent charging cable in the case because nothing else will fit (it's too small to hold any spare batteries for the flashlight).

18,RNCDGBY26QQUG,True,Great compat yet very bright!,"Personally, I think it's an amazing flashlight!
It's light weight and compact, yet has a long lasting battery.
It fully charges in about 4 hours give or take a few minutes. The rechargeable battery is great and uses a USB-C type charger.
The included one is only 6 inches long but any Android USB-C charger will work really...
From a full charge and constant use, my flashlight has lasted me about 3 nights.
It doesn't lose output as the battery drains, as in putting out weak or dim light when at the 1600 lumen or wherever setting you have it on. It either works at that brightness setting or it doesn't. If it does not have enough power to put out that level of intensity, it just skips over that setting all together.
I like that the light intensity button is flush against the body of the flashlight itself. It prevents it from accidentally getting caught on things as you're pulling it out or putting it back into the sheath, pocket, pouch, etc...
It is very durable as I've accidentally dropped it from various heights ranging from waist height to off the roof of a 1 storey building.
The included lanyard is great
(when you remember to actually put it around your wrist)
It has a good balance of both flood and pitch throughout all levels.

A few things that could be improved are:
1- The light intensity button to be able to scroll up and down the levels.
-- It only goes up in levels, and if you accidentally pass the level you want, you must go through all the levels to get to it again instead of just going back down 1 level.

2- The light intensity button to be more tactile.
-- It has a flat smooth button and easy to lose track of in the dark.
3- Have knurling or better grips down the body of the flashlight.
-- It is very slick and smooth all around making it slippery and easy to drop.

4- Having an actual lock out button or switch.
-- You can give it a quarter twist to simulate a ""lock out"" but you'll also be compromising the water tight seal to the battery as well...

5- Having a battery battery life indicator.
-- It has a 4 in 1 light indicator on the intensity button:
Solid green: Somewhere between 90-100% charge.
Flashing green: Somewhere between 10-89% charged.
Flashing red: Somewhere between 1-9%
Solid red: >1-0% basically dead...

5.5-- **is a subjective opinion** the sheath.
-- Personally as a security officer, I love the simplicity of the sheath. It's just a single fold over flap held down with velcro.
Means that I don't have to fumble around with any clasps, clips, buttons or anything. It's kind of snug and tight at first, but it stretches out a bit after use. I can easily draw my tools out when I need them, and put them away just as easily.
However, I could understand how a more robust sheath would be beneficial if you're a mountain climber, electrician, or someone who's going to be in compromising positions and need it to be secured down without a doubt.

All in all, it's a great flashlight and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great flashlight for a decent price range.
