0,RSS9WSL8X0T21,True,Mit neuem Super Akku 5000mAh!,"Nach nunmehr ca. 3 Wochen im Besitz der PD36r kann ich sagen, dass diese Taschenlampe alles hat, was man braucht. Sie ist außerordentlich hell. Den 21700 Akku habe ich noch nicht leer bekommen. Kein Wunder, das Ding hat 5000mAh. Der stärkste 18650 bisher hatte 3500 mAh. Die Lampe ist nur unwesentlich dicker und etwas schwerer, was der Haptik überhaupt nicht schadet. Im Gegenteil, sie liegt super in der Hand. Die PD36r kann zudem direkt durch Anschluß eines Micro USB Kabels (mitgeliefert) an jedem USB Anschluss bzw. USB Stecker (vom Smartphone) geladen werden. Natürlich steht jedem frei, sich noch zusätzlich ein externes Ladegerät zuzulegen. Ich habe z. B. eines, mit dem man mehrere Akkutypen mittels einer verschiebbaren Feder, laden kann. Im Urlaub sehr praktisch.
Die Leuchtstärken der PD36r sind ausgezeichnet (bis 1600 Lumen) und können im Einzelnen überall nachgelesen werden. Selbstverständlich ist auch wieder ein taktischer Abwehrmodus mit intensiven Lichtblitzen z. B. zur Tierabwehr, an Bord. Das Gehäuse ist sehr schön, ergonomisch und liegt ausgezeichnet in der Hand. Natürlich wird die PD36r aufgrund des wesentlich stärkeren Akkus von 5000 mAh und einer wesentlich höheren Lichtleistung in den oberen 2 Stufen, etwas schneller warm als das Vorgängermodell PD35, welches den gleichen kupferfarbenen Lichtstärke Schalter mit Akku Kontrolle hat. Es ist aber in den oberen Stufen auch schon enorm hell!
Das von mir erworbene Set enthält eine Tasche für den Gürtel, gleich 2 Akkus 21700 mit je 5000 mAh, sowie das Ladekabel fürs Aufladen direkt über die Lampe. Der Anschluss liegt verdeckt durch eine Gummikappe an der Unterseite des Gehäuses. Es wurde so eigentlich alles vorbildlich gelöst, ohne große Veränderungen in den Abmessungen der PD in Kauf nehmen zu müssen. Daher von mir volle 5 Sterne für das Produkt, Umfang des Pixxass Sets und Lieferzeit.",germany,"September 18, 2019",jwk1201,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:42:34.651771,2020-11-12 11:42:34.800373,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen Type-C USB Rechargeable EDC Tactical Flashlight with 2X Fenix Batteries and LumenTac Battery Organiser,4.8,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TJ9PYB8,"{'product dimensions': '13.59 x 2.64 x 2.54 cm; 86.18 Grams', 'batteries': '2 Lithium ion batteries required.

6,R15YROZML94LYB,True,Great light but could have been much better.,"Going to have to go with three stars for this light.

Yesterday I had the unfortunate accident of having my UC35v2 ran over by a forklift. Although it still works the case as you can imagine is now slightly damaged. So I had this bad boy overnighted to me.

My first impression is that I like the two part design vs the UC35v2 three part (the end cap is no longer removable). The build is solid although the casing metal seems much thinner than the UC35v2 which I assume is due to the thickness of the extended 21700 battery. We will see how durable it is over time.

The reason I am rating only three stars is the fact that it is honestly looks NO brighter than the UC35v2. In a pitch black room they both appear the same and the UC35v2 seems to have a more focused beam. For a difference of 600 lumens I would expect something that you can visually tell the difference. In all honesty the UC35v2 seems identical if not slightly brighter.

The extra battery case it came with is for a non protected 21700 battery so why even include it... The spare obviously doesnt fit and with one battery already in the light it's just extra trash...

I would honestly return and exchange for another UC35v2 but with the new USB-C charging port its just much easier since all my new phone chargers and laptop chargers are interchangeable.",the united states,"December 15, 2019",Michael Smith,3.0,0,2020-11-12 11:42:35.574167,2020-11-12 11:42:35.728755,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen Type-C USB Rechargeable EDC Tactical Flashlight with 2X Fenix Batteries and LumenTac Battery Organiser,4.8,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TJ9PYB8,,"#1,045,332 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

7,R17QUNX2D8FL8M,True,An Improved PD35 TAC?,"I bought this light to replace my beloved Fenix PD35 TAC. The PD35 still works fine, but I was lured to the PD36R because of it's 1,600 lumens turbo mode. A lot of the guys in my dept use the PD35 tac. In TAC mode, it's a very simple light - turn on by clicking the button on the end, turn off by clicking the button. Simple.
This PD36R is not as simple as that. Almost though. It remembers the last brightness setting, so you click the button on the end and click the button on the side (which also shows you the battery level when you turn it on) to the brightness level you want (there are 5 brightness levels). I have been leaving it on the 4th brightest level so when I turn the light on it's really bright. If I need even more light, I click the side button once and turn the brightness level up to 11.
Fenix makes nice lights. This one is well made. No complaints really, except one. The battery that is used is too long for my NiteCore chargers. So I have to use the charging port to charge the battery. It came with 2 batteries btw, which is a nice touch. Thanks Fenix.
Maybe Fenix will make a TAC version of this light? I don't know... but it has taken over the duties of my faithful PD35 TAC.

8,R1J93O6T9JV9R8,True,Solid and bright duty light,In typical Fenix fashion this is a high quality light. An upgrade in lumens and power from the PD35 this unit uses the larger 21700 battery. If you're used to the 18650 battery used in the PD35 it is smaller with less capacity so using the larger 21700 battery gives the PD36R over 50% more brightness than the PD35 with good runtime. I suggest getting a second battery as a spare is always a good idea. Keep in mind that usb charging a 5000mah battery will take some time. If you want faster charging you can get an external charger but the built in usb charger works fine overnight. This makes for an excellent primary duty light or backup. Multiple brightness settings are easy to use and handy to have available when you don't need the full daylight brightness this light puts out.,the united states,"December 3, 2019",Wes,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:42:35.878355,2020-11-12 11:42:36.041918,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen Type-C USB Rechargeable EDC Tactical Flashlight with 2X Fenix Batteries and LumenTac Battery Organiser,4.8,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TJ9PYB8,,"#1,045,332 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

9,RS08SEL3X51XT,True,Super bright!,"I chose this torch as an EDC light. It's a quality build, easy controls, nice sheath, great range of brightness. The charging port is convenient and battery status is easily determined. Two things that are slight negatives: the extra battery case is not designed for the included batteries, but the extra battery comes in it's own case, so kind of a moot extra. Also this light is HEAVY, I mounted it on a ball cap and it's almost unusable as an impromptu headlamp, unless you really wear a tight cap. Not impossible, just not designed well for the purpose. We'll see how it holds up, but so far it seems like it will work for me.

10,R3L91JCW0S7E7W,True,Excellent upgrade with a few small drawbacks.,"Bought this after carrying a PD-35 (2014) for several years with no issues. I was excited for the greater lumen output and higher capacity battery, as well as the battery level indicator built into the button. While it is a clear upgrade from the 35 and a quality flashlight over all, there are a few things I wish I had realized before I purchased it.

This flashlight runs off a 21700 battery, NOT a 18650. It says so right on the product page, but somehow I missed it. While this allows for a higher capacity, it also means that the battery is larger in size and incompatible with 18650 devices. Including chargers. I am unable to charge the batteries in my nightcore desk charger, as they are too tall.

The only way to charge them is with the flashlight itself, there is a charging port on the side of the light covered by a rubber bumper. It seems to seal completely, but if it were to open while submerged the exposed port would negate the waterproofing.

Charging is not pass through. While charging, the flashlight will not output more than 5 or so lumens. The extra battery is nice, but must be charged in the flashlight before being stored as a spare.

Fenix does manufacture a version of this battery that has a USB-C port directly on the battery, allowing it to be charged autonomously from the light. It is not the battery included with this bundle. I have not been able to find it on amazon, but it can be purchased directly from the manufacturer or from battery retailers. Look for the letter ""U"" at the end of the product ID to denote USB charging port.

Finally, this bundle does not include a red light filter. If you want a red light filter for this model, the PD36R, you will want to purchase a bundle that includes it. Color filters for the 35 are easily purchased here on amazon, the manufactures website, and various other locations. Colors filters for the 36 are nearly non-existent. I assume they are being manufactured, as there is a bundle that includes them. But outside that bundle, I have found no way to purchase a color filter for this specific model.

TL;DR - Awesome, reliable light. New, proprietary battery. Better battery available direct from manufacturer. Color filters not available anywhere.",the united states,"April 20, 2020",Calvin Ryan,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:42:38.382797,2020-11-12 11:42:38.515544,Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen Type-C USB Rechargeable EDC Tactical Flashlight with 2X Fenix Batteries and LumenTac Battery Organiser,4.8,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07TJ9PYB8,,"#1,045,332 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

15,R14A3KSHTSB8ZZ,True,"Awesome flashlight for the size, just use common sense because it gets real hot","I would give this flashlight 6 stars on its performance if I could. 3 hours of runtime at 1600 lumens for such a small flashlight is absolutely amazing. I give it 4 stars only because it runs very HOT at 1600 lumens. I had it in the tool pocket of my carhardtts when my leg started feeling something hot to the touch.

If Fenix had just engineered the switch to start at low power every time and allow me to up the power level as needed, then this would be a completely safe, totally awesome flashlight.

-Longer Turbo mode than most other 21700 EDC flashlights.
-USB-C charging. It's quick!
-Two-way body clip.

-Not tail standing. But I may only need to do that once in a blue moon.
