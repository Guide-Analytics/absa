18,R3DXM8GPYSJU4T,False,A great light but get the Nitecore EC20 instead,"NOTE! THE THRUNITE 1050 Lumen flashlight is cheaper and just as good as this, or the Nitecore EC20, this P12 was great in its day (2013) but has since been outdone!Don't pay more than 60$ for this.

*Purchased from amazon.com via Harris Outdoors for 65$, I ordered it from the US to Canada, with shipping it ran me about 90$ total and I got a battery charger and 2 X 4000 mAh batteries in addition to the factory case and lanyard.

*Before I go into the review I have to say that of the 60 products I've reviewed on Amazon.ca this is by far the best product for the money. Just be careful as many places are overcharging for it, its going for 60-75$ US currency.

1) Lightweight. Lighter than many flashlights in its class, won't bog you down.

2) BRIGHT. Projects far and a narrow beam, but still has very good spill. For the size it is simply incredibly bright. I bought a 200 lumen surefire 6PX pro a couple years back and thought that was INSANE at the time, this light is simply bat&*^% CRAZY BRIGHT!!! Its amazing how far this light tech has come in just a 5 years.

3) Lanyard hole. This is a great feature not available on enough lights, it ensures you dont lose it if wrapped around wrist when in sketchy situations.

4) VERSATILE AS *&%!. It can be a tactical light if you want it to be, or set to start off on minimal brightness, its up to you.

5) Stands on butt end and head end.

6) SECURITY. With all high output lights with aluminum casing they can be used as a defensive weapon, this would temporarily blind someone in an instant, and act as a kubaton.

7) SHAPE. Not having a head that bulges out is a huge asset when pocketing it.

8) LONG LASTING. Even on the 1 lumen setting it is surprisingly bright and easily usable. Haven't tested the 520 hours promise but even if half of that its impressive.

9) STROBE OPTIONS. Hold down button to engage strobe, hold down again for shorter strobe (SOS MORSE CODE, and again for even shorter, but be warned this could light up a rave! JUST INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF OPTIONS!!!

10) TWO BUTTONS. The main one at butt end is your on/ off switch. The smaller one on the side controls the mode (it will save the mode you have it set at).

11) WONT TURN ON IN POCKET. The on/off switch is just under flush with butt end, it would be a rare situation that caused this light to turn on unintentionally.

12) MOLLE compatible sheath. Fits perfectly on the shoulder strap of a 5-11 tactical or equivalent MOLLE pack for easy but secure access. Sheath has a lengthy velcro flap that holds it securely no matter what the orientation.

CONS
*Not many but a few

1) GRIP ISSUES. Compared to other flashlight in its class the grip suffers a bit especially towards the head end where its a more sleek textured aluminum.",canada,"November 14, 2014",Canadian Prepper,5.0,16,2020-10-27 22:17:44.007009,2020-10-27 22:17:44.114115,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

20,RKOGEDBH630OT,True,Good choice for dog walking,Paired with a Nitecore battery and charger this is proving to be a good choice for dog walking on dark winter nights.

24,R3RTXFCR5UBQ6Y,True,efficace e funzinale,"Corrisponde perfettamente alle descrizioni e ha un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.
La luce è buona con un fuoco centrale molto efficace anche se meno definito sui bordi rispetto ad altre torce (vedi Surfire), ma ciò non ostacola in alcun modo nell'utilizzo pratico. Il cono esterno, meno luminoso, ma più ampio di quello centrale è più largo di altre marche e consente di avere una buona visuale anche ai margini espandendo la zona di visibilità effettiva.
Le modalità e possibilità di scelta sono pratiche ed efficaci e fanno di questa torcia un utile attrezzo per molti tipi di utilizzo, dal professionale all'amatoriale. Per gli usi comuni bastano modelli anche meno potenti della stessa casa, magari di lunghezza minore e quindi portabili anche in tasca, ma dato il prezzo e la possibilità di utilizzare potenze minori di illuminazione ho scelto questa che ha azzerato tutte le altre in mio possesso.

25,R1SMQJ0RATAAA5,True,La piu potente torcia che io abbia mai utilizzato,"Il prodotto è arrivato il mattino seguente all'ordine. L'imballo conteneva la versione nuova della P12 ovvero la versione da 1000 Lumen anche se l'articolo parla della versione da 950 che è piu datata, la confezione contiene il manuale di istruzioni, di cui si può fare anche a meno visto la semplicità d'uso, la clip metallica per fissare la torcia alla cintura, l'anello tattico per migliorare l'impugratura quando la si tiene nel pugno sopra la spalla, la cordina per legare la P12 al polso, una custodia che può essere fissata alla cintura, due O-Ring di ricambio e un pulsante di accensione sostitutivo e il certificato di garanzia. Ho inserito nella torcia una batteria 18650 NON top di gamma, e utilizzando una batteria mediocre fa veramente molta luce, immagino quindi che con una batteria migliore che la luminosità sia ancora migliore. Il led è molto stabile, non da sfarfallii e il raggio e la proiezione sono estremamente omogenei oltre al fatto che scalda veramente poco per utilizzare un LED da 10W di potenza massima, le 4 modalità di potenza poi sono molto utili se si sta lavorando e non si vuole accecarsi, è infatti possibile abbassare il livello di luminostià a livelli intermedi, interessante poi la modalità Location Beacon che lancia un flash alla massima potenza disponibile ogni 3/4 secondi, utile per farsi individuare in condizioni estreme. Anche la modalità strobo ha la sua utilità, in caso di segnalazioni a distanza (per richiamare l'attenzione) o come difesa personale (l'uso della stroboscopica diretta disorienta temporaneamente), in ultima è presente la modalità SOS che lancia un segnale morse luminoso (punto punto punto linea linea linea punto punto punto). Il materiale è molto resistente e l'involucro è certificato IP8X quindi può essere immersa temporaneamente in acqua senza che subisca infiltrazioni dannose.

59,R2KN8PJBWNCSKX,True,Durchaus empfehlenswert!,"Ich nutze die Taschenlampe bei Nachtaktivitäten oder bei meinem Hobby. Dadurch dass die Taschenlampe ihre kompakte Form besitzt, ist sie optimal einsetzbar.

Die 1000 Lumen grenzen meiner Meinung nach schon fast an Körperverletzung, aber ein normaler Mensch versucht damit ja nicht andere Menschen zu belästigen. Die verschiedenen Modi funktionieren einwandfrei, die Taschenlampe hat 4 Helligkeitsstufen. Die Modi (Strobo/SOS) leuchten in vorgegebener Helligkeit (ich denke es liegt um die 750 Lumen).

Kleine bis mittlelgroße Räume werden komplett ausgeleuchtet wenn man die Taschenlampe einschaltet (bei 1000 Lumen).

60,R3AW0SCMGBVRHC,True,コレはいい！　丈夫で明るい！,仕事で使ってますが、大変重宝してます！　意外とハイパワー950ルーメンモードを多用するので、電池代が大変です。またハイパワーモードを多用すると、LEDの寿命が極端に短くなります。現在2本目ですが、調子が悪くなりかけてます。兆候は「点灯しない→軽く叩くと点灯する」　この状態が徐々にひどくなり、最後には1ルーメンモードでしか点灯しなくなります。専門店に問い合わせると、「高負荷ハイパワー系のLEDライトの寿命は1年程度と思って下さい」「シュアファイアなんかはハイパワーモデルでも500ルーメン程度に抑えてるでしょう？」と言われました。確かに1本目は1年強で寿命を迎えました。まぁ、あくまでも使い方次第ですが、仕事で多用する場合は寿命は1年です。通常使いなら210ルーメンモードで大半の状況に対応できます。,japan,"May 10, 2016",kobakoba,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:12.256572,2020-10-27 22:18:12.377004,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

気に入ってましたが、何か物足りなく、さらに買い足して・・・。

P7→T7→MT7→P5R→UF WF-5-1B→XTAR TZ20→

ついに出会ったNIGHT CORE P12。

〇全体の仕上げが良いからか、素手で持ってもチクチクしたりしない。
〇ON・OFFがテールスイッチ。明るさの切り替えはサイドスイッチ。
しかも、微→L→M→H→微→Lの順で替わるので助かる。
巡回中はほとんど「L」で、明るく照らしたい時にサイドスイッチを
押せばM→Hiと明るくなる。ストロボも可能ですが使ってません。
〇OFFにしたとき、その時の明るさを記憶している。
〇細くて軽い！
〇ホルスターやクリップも付属してますが使ってません。
タクティカルリングは指の掛かりも良いし、XTAR TZ20の様にチクチクしない。
〇Hiで90分（KEEPPOWER18650 3100mAh使用）確認。熱くなるが持てない程ではないです。
〇電池残量が半分以下になると、サイドスイッチか薄く青く点滅して知らせてくれる。
〇巡回には「L」と「M」で十分。Hiは明るすぎるくらい。
〇Hiの明るさは「UF WF-5-1B」「XTAR TZ20」より少し明るい。
色は「UF WF-5-1B」と似てる。「XTAR TZ20」より白いですが
P7より黄色いか・・・？。
〇レッドレンザーのズームが気に入ってましたが、単焦点をを使って見て
巡回にはこれで十分。むしろ防水なのでこちらの方が安心。
〇テールスイッチはやや固い感じですが、タクティカルリングのおかげで
押しやすいので、片手で十分取扱出来ます。

細くて軽くて手になじむので大変気に入りました。
電池の持ちは、夜間巡回１時間×４回（ほとんど「LoとM」）使用で
まだサイドスイッチは点滅しません。
室内で「Hi」で試したところ、８０分でゆっくりの点滅がはじまりました。
９０分までほとんど明るさが変わらない事を確認しました。
電池残量がさらに減ると、早い点滅になるそうですが未確認です。

I figured that it was a fluke. I got tired of their nonsense and ordered another one from Amazon. One month later....guess what happened! The same exact thing. This company charges premium price for something very unreliable. After being questioned like I was an invalid with the first light, I assumed that this wasn't a normal problem. The purchase of the second light with the identical problem a month after purchase, tells me that this is common place, and unless you pay upwards of $100, this company will not warrant their product!

83,R6606EDN607NU,True,The sweet spot of camping and outdoor flashlight design.,"Now my favorite light. I have a dozen or more tactical lights, two of which are Nitecores.
Holster is first class, very heavy nylon webbing. It has a Velcro closure that allows you to put this over a belt, without taking the belt off. You can also thread your belt thru a loop that is sewn to the holster. It also has a D hook for attaching this to a pack.

Flashlight is powered by a 18650 battery or the CR123s. Low is 1 lumen, perfect for use at night, bathroom trips, etc. Will not blow out your night vision. Beam is not overly broad, or laser focused. Perfect. Turob is as expected, turns my back yard into daytime. I have a P30 that has a laser focused beam--good to play around with-search for wildlife etc, but overall not that useful. This will be my carry flashlight in camp, and outdoor excursions as the beam width is just right. For me it is too big for an EDC. I would use my AA for that. Its a bit on the heavy side, as expected for a well built 18650.

I would never again buy a light that does not have a tailswitch as the on/off switch. [Their EC20 is without a tailswitch, and you have to unscrew the base to carry it in your pocket] This P12 also has a clip, which prevents it from dropping all the way to the bottom of your pocket. Pretty darn near perfect.

87,R1MZ9NX9JY7NTK,True,Love this Nitecore,"I am pleased with the Nitecore P12 2015 tactical light. Slightly before buying this light I bought a Vizeri 460. In comparing them I was somewhat surprised that when focused for throw the Vizeri would illuminate better at a distance than the Nitecore. Testing both at high setting shining into my eyes to simulate blinding an attacker, I found that the 460 lumen Vizeri was just as blinding as the Nitecore. And the Vizeri is a fair amount cheaper.

So why the 5 stars for this Nitecore in light of the foregoing (pun intended): its construction is a bit better, as evidenced by the smoothness of threading the end cap on with both lights treated with silicone lubricant, it is thinner and has a sturdy belt clip - important factors for EDC, has a body component that impedes rolling when laid horizontally on a table surface, can measure battery strength and will automatically warn with light signals when the battery is getting low, and a crenelated end for use when engaging with an attacker is not avoidable (do just escape rather than engage if at all possible). These factors make me pleased with the Nitecore, despite the fact that for blinding brightness the two lights seem to be about equal.

88,R5TA578MHPC5J,True,"So far it's great! UPDATE 9 months, broken","UPDATE: I don't use the light a lot so I got 9 months out of it before it freaked out and won't go brighter than lowest dim setting. If I leave it alone for a few hours, it seems to work, then it stops functioning correctly after 5 minutes or so. I've changed batteries. I've put in new CR123s ( since it stopped working with ALL my rechargeable 18650 batteries). Will not buy Nitecore again.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: So far it's great! After buying several tactical lights from some other manufacturers and being disappointed, I did research and I bought this Nitecore light. I like the weight, the functions, the button operation, and the brightness. No lab tests but testing in my back yard I can see distant objects slightly better with my Olight 900 lumen light, but I still prefer the Nitecore to that one. The very slight brightness difference is hard to notice and there are other factors that make the Nitecore a better buy.

A couple years ago I bought an Olight tactical LED that was 320 lumens and I really liked it. It lasted and performed well, so I bought its big brother when I wanted a brighter one. Unfortunately the new 900 lumen Olight has a really lame/unreliable way to cycle through the brightness levels by twisting the flashlight head, which started to become unreliable after a couple months. Around that same time the original Olight I liked started to short out and flicker a lot. Olights have proven unreliable over time, so I hope Nitecore's quality reputation over time, matches the initial strong performance.",the united states,"September 7, 2015",Larry B,1.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:20.156872,2020-10-27 22:18:20.283773,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I have absolutely zero complaints to the form and function of this flashlight, the problem is the design of the internals.

Due to it's all metal construction, this light is pretty heavy for it's size, if you drop it once (which you're bound to do if you're actually using the light) even from about 3ft, you might wreck the internal components.

I have gone through about 4 of these things in 2 years.. I keep buying them because they're great lights, but one maybe two drops and that's it.. they're done. On 2 of the lights, the little plastic circular thing and the battery lead on the bulb module have broken off completely rendering it useless. The other 2 lights remained intact but they simply stopped working after accidental drops from a relatively low height.

All that being said, this is still the best light for the price and as long as you realize it's fragile nature and are willing to risk it, it's worth the price for it's function.. in fact I just replaced another one.. again.. for the 5th time.",the united states,"June 16, 2019",AR305,2.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:20.298732,2020-10-27 22:18:20.427117,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

99,R14N42V03R55P6,True,Good light for the money,"I compared a Nitecore P12 to a Shadowhawk X800, which is in about the same price range, & reached the following conclusions.

Advantages of the Nitecore P12: Much brighter, more modes, longer-lasting batteries (two CR123s or one 18650 rechargeable), more watertight, smaller & lighter, low-battery indicator, comes with holster & pocket clip.

Advantages of the Shadowhawk X800: adjustable beam width, less expensive batteries (three AAAs).

I prefer the separate on/off & mode-switching buttons of the P12 (on/off on the end cap, mode-switching on the side, perfectly placed for thumb operation) to the single end-cap button that does everything on the X800. I suppose that's a judgment call. The only reason I can imagine for choosing the X800 would be if adjustable beam width overrides all other performance criteria, in which case you may not need a tactical flashlight.

Bottom line: If you're in the market for a tactical flashlight in this price range, you could do worse than the Nitecore P12.",the united states,"June 30, 2016",Grandpa,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:26.777640,2020-10-27 22:18:26.897359,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The lowest setting throws just enough light to see your immediate surroundings in the dark but not bright enough to ruin night vision.

There are two additional intermediate settings that will probably get the most use. The holster doesn't seem like standard MOLLE but it gets the job done on the pack or on a belt. The included wrist lanyard works, I guess, but it does get in the way unless you're sure to use it every time.

Since it doesn't work on standard alkaline batteries, I recommend getting at least 2 quality 18650 Li-Ion batteries and a decent charger.

I'm using Panasonic 18650 batteries and the flashlight will operate intermittently unless I really (and I mean really) tighten everything down.

I have about 500 rounds through the gun and the light still works as intended. I only wish Nitecore had a momentary only tail cap.

105,R3EWHJ6EWSDO3N,True,The 1000 lumen setting is very bright and focused,"I've owned the P12 for over 2 years and would easily recommend. The 1000 lumen setting is awesome, but it gets hot and consumes battery life, and yet for those times when you want to see some distant spot, it's simply incredible that you get to see so much more than you thought possible with a flashlight. The 240 lumen setting is still very bright and in my case, the most used which will still get you about 20 hrs of battery life. The 70 lumen is barely adequate by today's standards, but it's still better than most incandescent bulky flashlights. The 1 lumen setting is hardly perceptible, which has created situations in where I thought the light was off, it wasn't, thus stored it only to eventually find I had a dead battery (remember to use the tail switch for on and off). This Nitecore light version does not come with batteries so I purchased (2) 18650 rechargeable batteries and rotate them so that when needed, I have one battery with a full charge. This P12 Nitecore has become our ""go to"" flashlight in our household. I liked it so much that I went on to purchase a second for our car. It is compact, lightweight, extremely bright and reliable so that wherever I go, I can see my surroundings well. Nitecore is manufactured in China and that's where their support is located. That said, they're on China time and response is slow and very underwhelming, hence the 4 star.

106,R1KN27ZB4SIR9B,True,Great light. Would buy again,"Cons:
- does not include batteries (takes 18650s)
- no charge port, so you'll need to buy a charger
- no battery charge indicator
Pros:
- Lighter and more comfortable to use than similar spec'd Streamlight
- Good value for lumens @ 1000 for $42
- Has a great throw with about a 8-10"" hot spot
- Really good mAH efficiency
- Fits well in your pocket
- Should make a great gun light considering the low weight

I work in the power industry where a good flashlight is a must. I need a light that penetrates the suspended ash and coal dust in the air, gummed up sightglasses and far off objects. So far this light has accomplished all this. I don't know how durable/resistant this light is to water or fine dust. I'll report back if I remember to.
I gave 5 stars for functionality, efficiency and ease of use. At the end of the day that's all that really matters.
I've owned 5 or 6 different lights including a couple of Streamlights. The SLs are great but I prefer this nitecore because it is more efficient. It does a good job of managing its energy. It doesn't seem to get as hot as my SLs of similar lumen output and I haven't HAD to charge the battery.

108,RUU3KQ6FK1MO0,True,Good value at this price,"Compared to the similar Fenix PD35, this light acquits itself rather well, at a price $30 less than the fenix. Slightly less robust construction and a lower quality tailswitch than the fenix (spongy and gritty compared to the Fenix), but overall good performance, and side/mode switch has better tactile accessibility than the equivalent switch on the fenix. Overall a good tradeoff vs the fenix... significantly lower price, yet acceptably lower quality. This presumes that the yet-to-be-determined reliability and longevity of the Nitecore will be comparable to the Fenix. What is notable is that the Nitecore was clearly designed with the use of a 18650 cell in mind --- the cell is a perfect fit, with adequate clearance radially and axially. (This is using an Orbtronics 3400 maH). In contrast, the same 18650 is a tight fit in the Fenix, and the added length compared to 2XCR123 makes for added compression stress on the tailcap spring. Odd, when it's considered that the 18650 is the power supply means recommended by Fenix.

Having said that, the Fenix appears to be the better light, in terms of external and internal construction details and quality, and better range of lumen level selections.

119,R16YH67IUBUMV8,True,Saves my life several times per week,"My friends think I'm crazy, because during the summer months I hike the desert mountains around Phoenix at night. That's good because it cools down to a balmy 100 degrees. That's bad because rattlesnakes come at dusk as the evening ""cools"". Fortunately for me, the flashlight beam is the perfect blend of diffuse and spot lighting to be perfect for trail hiking. That's really important because the beam isn't adjustable, which keeps the size and weight down. It also feels great in your hand and comes with an adjustable wrist lanyard. The selectable levels of brightness can positively light up the night. It's so bright I rarely use the brightest level. I generally keep it on level two or three depending upon how much natural moonlight there is. This flashlight allows me to see every spider, cliff-edge, coyote, cholla, scorpion, and rattlesnake so that I can avoid them all.

If you're still reading I assume you're really interested in this flashlight. My other tip to you is to buy a charger and rechargeable batteries. I bought the Nitecore D4 Smart Charger and a set of Nitecore 3400mAh 18650 batteries. The disposable CR123A batteries (it takes two) work just fine. However, the rechargeable 18650 battery (it's longer so you only need one) seems to last much longer. It's not an obvious feature on the flashlight, but if you hold down the brightness selection button when you turn the flashlight on, the selection button will blink a bright blue light indicating the voltage remaining in the battery. Three blinks, followed by a pause, and then two more blinks indicate the battery has dropped to 3.2V (+/- 0.1V). So it's easy to know when it's time to recharge.

This is my go-to EDC light and the best flashlight I have ever owned. I am most impressed with its build quality, overall very solid and it just feels like it will last a long time. The rubber switches have good tactile and audible feedback when pressed. The light offers 4 light settings and SOS/Strobe modes are a bonus. I find myself using 70/240 lumen settings most often, but love having the 1000 lumens just in case. The brightness level is great and really more than enough for my type of use.

The flashlight does stand so you can set it down have your hands free with the room lit. The base of the light is also solid metal and could be used to defend yourself. I am using Edison Brite 18650 batteries and usually charge every 3-4 weeks. The light sees about 12hrs of use/week with 70% usage in 70 lumen mode, and 30% alternating between 240 and 1000 lumen modes.

The one negative I can dock on this flashlight is when using 1000 lumen mode for over 1 minute, the light gets warm and after 3 minutes of use, it gets quite hot. According to the specs, it says the light can run 1000 lumen mode for 1hr and 15 minutes. I couldn't imagine running it at that setting for that long as it would get way too hot.

191,R25826VFR80A44,True,"Very bright, but dead after about a year.","I'll preface this by saying that I own 3 Nitecore flashlights. I thought this one would be perfect for backpacking/camping, etc because of the compact size. The light is extremely bright, seemed durable and well constructed. I liked it a lot until . . .

About 6 months after purchase the brightness mode button stopped working - instead of multiple modes, I only got dim or medium brightness. Now, a little more than a year later, the light won't even turn on. I tried multiple battery configurations (rechargeable, standard lithium, etc). When I looked up the issue, I noticed that there are multiple 1-star ratings for this light for the same reasons. Lesson learned: no more Nitecore.

I buy LED flashlights for three reasons: brightness, reliability and durability (no filament in an LED). This light is nothing more than a paperweight after a little more than a year of very occasional use.

So, while it seems durable and well constructed, don't let appearance fool you. I expect MUCH more for a light that costs this much!

206,R1C8CCY5LIKIO8,True,In a word: UltraFantasticallyAwesome,"I bought this light for my brother's birthday in May, and he absolutely loved it. At the same time I ordered a Surefire 6PX Pro for myself, and on comparison, the Nightcore has much nicer machining of the body. There were tool marks on the Surefire that gave it a bit of a cheaper feel than my previous 6P model that I bought back in the Military.

Anyway, one of the things I love about this light compared to the Surefire 6PX Pro is that the Nitecore has a glass or mineral crystal lens, instead of the plastic one on the Surefire. After cleaning the lens on my Surefire once it developed annoying swirl marks that the Nitecore won't be susceptible to.

Out of the box, the Nitecore feels like a normal tactical flashlight should. I've been using Tac-lights in the Military since 2004, so I'm pretty familiar with their construction and operation at this point. The box comes with a bunch of accessories and spare parts, such as replacement O-rings and spare tail cap button. This is a very nice touch, and shows that Nitecore is serious about the long-term wear of their product.

The user interface of this light is fantastic. The last brightness level is remembered at power-on, so there is no need to annoyingly cycle through levels by pressing the tail-cap multiple times (looking at you, Surefire). There is a blue LED that blinks when the batteries are getting low, and also a nice feature where if you hold the mode button and tail-cap button at the same time, the battery voltage is displayed through a series of blinks. This is a very nice touch.

So far, I'm really impressed. This light is noticeably brighter than the Surefire, offering 4 brightness settings compared to two, and also the epilepsy-inducing ""seizure mode"", SOS and location beacon modes that can be activated by holding down the mode button.

The only real negative is the batteries fit a bit loose inside the barrel. I'm using the CR123s, so the other battery option might fit tighter.

Also, the head of the light gets really hot after running in turbo mode for a few minutes. The hotness isn't a negative though, as any high-powered flashlight with this output is going to create the same heat. It won't burn you, but it does get very warm on it's highest setting. Just expect that.

So impressed was I by this light that I ordered one for myself which came today.

214,R1PSGNK506KK01,True,"Great Light, Very Bright, Lots of Features","Just got this for the last mission trip for Haiti. It's a bit large to EDC in your pocket, but worked great on our trip. (My fav. EDC is super-handy LRI Proton, which throws a crazy beam from one AA battery). This torch lights up the night and has plenty of spill so you can get a good swath of light, even on the lower settings. On full, it's pretty blinding. With the 18650 rechargeable battery, it has even more capacity and you don't feel bad about buying those fairly expensive 123 batteries. For car or mobile use, I keep a pair of the 123s as backup, and one rechargeable batter near the charger so I can switch out as needed and keep a freshly charged one in the light. On the trip, the ability to tailstand was important as we had a few nights with no electricity and this, aimed at the ceiling was our room light. Also love the voltage indicator via the lighted switch (it flashes a number of times to indicate the current voltage) and that it also indicates low voltage with intermittent flashes. Two things I'd like even better, if it had a more focused beam, but that's hard to do without this style of reflector. Also, love the Four Sevens interface where you can give the head a half twist to access high beam and strobe and would love to see that on this light. Finally, the ""moonbeam"" setting is great for minimal light needed-tasks and for extending several hundred hours of light on one charge/set of batteries).

Update: contacted amazon for return, they passed me on to the US supplier, who then passed me off to Nitecore in China, who then passed me off to a US distributor.

Form factor, they are all virtually identical in size and weight, although the ThruNite feels ever so slightly lighter than the Fenix or NiteCore. All three are excellent lights with only small differences between them. But the differences are noticeable enough to opine on.

Max Brightness: 1) ThruNite 2) NiteCore 3) Fenix. Don't get me wrong. All three are blindingly bright and the differences are minimal.
Feel and aesthetics: 1) NiteCore 2) Fenix 3) ThruNite Note: All three are of excellent build quality. The NiteCore just feels and looks the most bad ass.
Strobe: 1) Fenix (it oscillates the speed. Most disorienting.) 2) NiteCore (Remembers last setting so if you turn it off with strobe and turn it back on strobe will start again. Impressive. 3) ThruNite
Brightness Levels: 1) ThruNite (5 levels with ""Firefly"" mode) 2) NiteCore (Only 4 levels but has a more useful low setting. 3) Fenix (5 levels)

240,R36ZGP8W2Q012T,True,"Works Great, Very Bright!!","Works Great, Very Bright!!. I've had it for 4 months now, and i'm satisfied with it's performance. But it does get hot after a few mins when put on the highest setting. I am using the large 3400ma batteries at 18.3mm diameter, so it'll take the ""big"" batteries. But the anode cap won't reach the contact on the back of the bulb, so i put a small neodymuim magnet I had 4.78mm x 4.7 cylinder i had lying around, and that solved my problem. I believe that the other ppl that have had this unit fail after a time are leaving them on the high setting and letting them ""burn up"" or letting the led material melt, and that is the reason they fail. This does get very hot on the high setting. If it was intended to stay there for more than about 10 mins, they would have put a ""heat sink"" on it to cool it. If you need 900 lumens for more time than 10 mins, you need a lantern. and the 500 lumen setting is sufficient for most needs. Another thing I love about this light, it stays bright at all stages of battery discharge, down to around 2.7v is cutoff for my 18650's.

252,RFBNPOLZCVNVV,True,P12 2015 vs prev generation P12,"For starters this is my second Nitecore P12 and my 4th Nitecore Flashlight purchase. Working the nightshift, having a reliable flashlight could mean the difference of you going or not going home. I personally own 2-Nitecore SRT-7's. (One for work and the other as a EDC) I really trust the brand.
Recently my previous generation P12 stopped working for no apparent reason. I have since been intouch with Nitecore and they have advised me to contact the original seller who is independent from Amazon to rectify this issue. I've done that and the case is still on going.
So far, I like the 2015 P12 but I like the previous generation because of the much longer throw. From the first time I turned this new 2015 P12 on I immediately knew that the throw was significantly less. I would still highly recommend this flashlight even though I had a issue with my last one for no apparent reason. As a EDC OR CAMPING FLASHLIGHT ..... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. I only gave it 4 stars because of the limited throw but Nitecore does tell you this in their description.

One time, I had the light in my pants pocket on low setting, without knowing it the light was on for two days straight - I checked the voltage and it had dropped only a little bit: easily could have run another two days on the low setting. I also have the other Nitecore flashlight, which has the on/off switch combined with the mode switch on the side. I didn't like turning on the light with a side switch. This P12 flashlight has a separate on/off switch on the tail end - I prefer this arrangement.

274,R3GZ2EFIQ9PDMZ,True,Disappointed,"My rating has more to do w/ the Amazon advertisement of the P12 2015 Nitecore flashlight then the light itself since I haven't been able to evaluate the product w/o batteries..? The add clearly shows the flashlight & batteries in the picture but fails to mention ""Batteries Not Included"". Additionally I added on the Nitecore i2 Intellicharger (which also shows batteries in the picture but were not included). Now I have approximately $70+ tied up in a flashlight that is inoperable! In order to get to a place where I can actually use & evaluate this light I had to spend an additional $37 for the batteries that work both in the light & the charger. Now my investment is over $100 for a light made in China that may or may not be any good...?

Reading some of the reviews i was skeptical but for the price and what this light offers i gave it a shot . When it first arrived i inspected it and function checked , everything worked like it should so i did 5 drop test from about 5 feet on thin carpeted floor and it passed then tried wooden floor same height and amount of times and all good . Now it is mounted on a 7.62x39 rifle and has seen 500 or more rounds shot with it and is still working . Battery life seems pretty good so far I've been messing with it a lot on the mid setting mostly which is real bright at 240 lumens and the 2 cr123 i'm using are still going , the high setting is incredibly bright for the size of this light .

363,R2KN2EKO1OCR59,True,少々期待外れ,"NITECOREのMT2Aを購入してこのメーカーのライトに興味を持ち、950lmでこの価格ということで購入しました。
本体のつくりは非常にしっかりしており、防水2m、1.5mからの落下に耐えるというタフなライト。
最低1lmまで出力を抑えられ、手元だけを照らすペンライトのような使い方もできます。
テスト用電池は付属していませんでしたが、18650電池でかなりの時間使えますのでランニングコストは気になりません。
モードボタンの青色LEDは、電池残量が低下したとき、輝度をHi→Loに変えたときにも点滅することがあります。
テール部にはクラウンがついており、誤点灯防止にもなります。また、スイッチの操作時にも邪魔にならない形状です。
本体サイズが小さいためかHiモードで点灯させると十数秒でヘッド部がほんのり熱を持ちますが、問題ないレベルです。
ヘッド部がフラットになっており、立てたとき光が漏れない上、Loモードは点いているか分からないレベルの明るさまで抑えられているため、消し忘れに注意が必要です。
私の持っている他社製ライトのLEDLENSER T7M(400lm)、F1(400lm)、H14R.2(850lm)、GENTOS SF755(700lm)との比較ですが、カタログスペックの950lmは言い過ぎではないかと思います。個体差や電池（私はKEEPPOWERの3400mAhリチウムイオン電池を使用)の関係もあると思いますし、照射特性も異なりますので正確には分かりませんが個人的には600‾700lm程と思います。比較したところ、SF755(700lm)とほぼ同等か、少し755の方が明るいかな？といったレベルでした。H14R.2(850lm)との比較では、明らかにH14Rの方が明るいです。NITECORE製のライトMT2A(280lm)との比較では、、照射面はP12のほうが若干広く、明るさは約2倍くらいに感じました。
950lmという数字に惹かれて買った私には少々期待はずれでしたが、総合的にはよくできた良いライトだと思います。",japan,"October 14, 2014",Takumi,3.0,0,2020-10-27 22:20:42.998630,2020-10-27 22:20:43.121865,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

- hotspot mit merklichem donut hole, donhut hole hell weiss umrandet jedoch mit dunklerem grünlich'n dirty Zentrum. Gehört zu Produktionsschwankungen made in China
- ziemlich grüner tint bin im Vergleich zu CW Referenz-XML Talas. gibt Schlimmeres, z.B. Olight und Foursevens, aber gehört mit zum grünlichsten wo gibt. wer auf Tint Wert legt, sollte lieber nicht kaufen. wenn die P12 die erste und einzige power LED Tala in Ihrem Besitz sein wird, dann nicht so schlimm, weil dann der Tint nicht so auffällt wegen Fehlens einer Vergleichsmöglichkeit
- so richtig grüner tint bin auf den niedrigeren Helligkeitslevels oweia. sowas muss/darf wirklich nicht sein!
- alignment Problem. Tala sieht nicht so aus wie auf dem amazon Bildchen
- cigar grip Ring aus schwarzem Plastik, ist schon einigen Nutzern sofort kaputt gegangen. sehr zerbrechliches billiges Teil und nicht für den realen harten Einsatz bestimmt! Hätte aus T20C2 Gummi oder aus TK22 Aluminium sein müssen. man macht sich absolut lächerlich wenn einem das Teil vor Augenzeugen kaputt geht, z.B. beim Stoß gegen die Wand oder auf den Boden o.ä. Man macht sich damit für den Rest des Lebens zur Lachnummer Made In China Schrott
- kaputtbarer Verpolungsschutz aus Bruchplastik
- nicht doppelt Feder-gelagerte Batterie, daher ungeeignet fürs mounting auf Schusswaffen
- sperrig große Tala, aber nun ehrlich. weder schlank noch kurz noch kompakt!
- lächerlicher kleiner billiger pocket clip, brüchiges Teil
- weniger hell, weniger throw als TX25C2 XM-L2
- miserabel regulierte Helligkeitsstabilisierung
- Helligkeitssprung zwischen höchster und zweithöchster Stufe ist zu hoch
- Voltanzeige ungenau
- nix Besonderes oder Spannendes, ist halt eine billige China-Taschenlampe

Jeder Premium Talahersteller hat eine 1x18650 Stablampe im Programm. Fenix war der allererste Hersteller, aktuell mit PD32/PD32UE/PD35, und ist und bleibt das Vorbild in der Branche. Die anderen, das sind die Nachahmer (Thrunite TN12 2014, Eagletac D25LC2, N-Light ST50, usw.) und somit auch die Nitecore P12. Die P12 ist sicherlich gutes Licht für gutes Gelt und kann deswegen uneingeschränkt empfohlen werden.

429,RW9JUWMW5D36L,True,"Sehr hell, aber bei täglichem Gebrauch nicht dauerhaft standfest","Das ist nun die vierte Taschenlampe gleicher Bauart. Die Lampe ist ständig in der Hosentasche. Das Licht ist extrem gut, die Lichtleistung fällt aber im Laufe der Zeit merklich ab, bleibt aber dennoch überdurchschnittlich. Das Gehäuse ist super robust, bis auf Abnutzung der Lackierung vermutlich nicht kaputt zu bekommen.Die Kombination aus Einschalter am Ende und Funktionsauswahl am Leuchtenkopf ist zweckmäßig und funktioniert einwandfrei. Leider - und das ist die eigentliche Schwachstelle der Leuchte - löst sich der Batteriekontakt (Foto: in der Mitte des Leuchtenkopfes, bzw. seine Kunsttoffhalterung im Laufe der Zeit von der Platine. Dann fällt der Kontakt beim Batteriewechsel einfach raus (im Dunkeln oder auf der Baustelle kaum wiederzufinden) oder der Kunsttoffring löst sich ganz und verrutscht dann beim Gebrauch, so dass die Leuchte flackert bzw. immer auf den Kopf geklopft werden muss, damit sich der Ring zentrert und wieder Strom fließen kann.
Beim dritten Ausfall ist der Versuch den Ring mit Sekundenkleber festzusetzen leider nicht gelungen, die Platine scheint den Kleber nicht zu vertragen, deshalb musste eine neu her.
Fazit: es ist eine sehr gute überdurchschnittlich helle Leuchte, aber leider nicht robust genug, um den professionellen täglichen Einsatz über mehrere Jahre zu überstehen.",germany,"September 18, 2019",vagedes,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:21:12.351885,2020-10-27 22:21:12.469755,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

435,R9V3F6J8D7FGV,True,"Tolles Licht, tolle Funktionen, aber schlechte Haltbarkeit","Ich brauche sowohl im Hobby als auch beruflich eine leichte, aber leistungsstarke Lichtquelle. Die Wahl fiel auf Grund der vorhandenen sehr guten Rezensionen auf die P12. Sie hat rund ein Jahr lang fast täglich auch klaglos ihren Dienst verrichtet - und wurde dabei zugegebenermaßen nicht geschont, aber auch mechanisch nicht sonderlich belastet.

Nach Ablauf des Jahres brach der Abstandshalter am unteren Ende der Akkuaufnahme. An sich kein Beinbruch, denn die Lampe funktioniert auch ohne. Eine genaue Ursache konnte ich nicht ausmachen, vermute aber, dass der nur lose eingelegte, schwächliche Plastikring sich beim Einlegen des Akkus verkantete und dabei beschädigt wurde. Gravierender war ein etwas später auftretender Wackelkontakt, der das Einschalten der Lampe verhinderte. Ursächlich ist nicht der sonst übliche Verdächtige - der Schalter, Das Problem liegt irgendwo in der Elektronik des Lampenkopfes, die nicht zugänglich ist. Ließ sich das anfänglich noch durch Klopfen an die Lampe beseitigen, ging natürlich kurze Zeit später gar nichts mehr.

Folgerichtig an den Anbieter als Gewährleistungsfall gesendet. Heute kam das Päckchen als nicht zustellbar zurück. Aber das ist ja nicht dem Hersteller anzulasten.

Von der Größe her für den täglichen Gebrauch geeignet, ebenso als Kubotan (Druckpunktverstärker zu SV-Zwecken) nutzbar. Ich habe sie letztendlich gekauft, weil sie ein paar mehr Features (z.B. Ladestandsanzeige der Batterie, Tail-Stand) gegenüber der Fenix PD35 hat.

437,R13314E2BT04VP,True,Enttäuschend,"Als bekennender Fan von LED-Taschenlampen besitze ich inzwischen um die 20 Exemplare dieser Lichtwunder: diverse Fenix, Olight, Thrunite oder seit neuestem einige Modelle günstigerer Marken wie Sofirn, Thorfire und Atactical/Wowtac.
Und eben auch die 2014 angeschaffte Nitecore P12 für die ich 64,90€ bezahlt habe.

Im Vergleich von Handhabung, Lichtleistung und Verarbeitung reihte sich die P12 anfangs solide im Mittelfeld ein.
Die Fenix PD35 bleibt mein persönlicher Favorit, hier schätze ich besonders das hervorragende Lichtbild (eher warmweißes Licht, sehr gelungene Abstimmung Flood/Throw) und die absolut makellose Bedienung über den präzisen Seitenschalter mit seinen knackigen Druckpunkten und den sehr sinnvoll abgestimmten Leuchtmodi.
Die Olight Modelle punkten mit einzigartiger Kompaktheit, womit man deren Premiumpreis rechtfertigen kann.

Die Nitecore P12 sah ich auf einer Stufe mit der Thrunite TN12 (Modelle 2014 und 2016). Ein Vorteil gegenüber den nur halb so teuren Thrunites war für mich die Ladestandsanzeige der P12.
Auch die neuen günstigen Modelle wie die Thorfire TK155, die Atactical A1S oder die Sofirn SP32 halten mit - allerdings habe ich da noch keine längeren Erfahrungswerte. Allemal beeindruckend finde ich die Tatsache, dass man sich zum Preis einer Nitecore P12 diese drei Modelle zusammen zulegen kann.

Jetzt aber zur eigentlichen Kritik an der P12:

Mit den von mir favorisierten Panasonic Akkus NCR18650B (ungeschützt) konnte ich die Lampe überhaupt nicht betreiben - im Gegensatz zu allen anderen besteht sie auf einen erhabenen Pluspol. Also für 19 Euro noch einen entsprechenden Akku angeschafft - zuerst Olight dann später nochmal Nitecore. Ärgerlich aber na gut...

Und obwohl ich die P12 nur sporadisch nutzte, traten bereits nach kurzer Zeit 'Aussetzer' auf. Manchmal ließ sie sich erst nach mehrmaligem Betätigen des Heckschalters einschalten, manchmal fing das Licht an zu flackern und ging sogar ab und zu ganz aus. Leichtes Rütteln oder seitliches Klopfen des Lampenkopfes in der Hand half meist weiter.

Nach 2 1/2 Jahren ging dann irgendwann gar nichts mehr. Zwar blitzte das Teil beim Eindrücken des Heckknopfes noch kurz auf, Einschalten gelang aber nicht mehr. Ein- oder zweimal startete noch der Strobe-Modus, den konnte man aber nicht verlassen.

Um es kurz zu machen: die Nitecore P12 konnte mich von Beginn an nicht begeistern, zum Schluss habe ich mich sogar monatelang immer wieder damit rumgeärgert.

In 5 Jahren LED-Taschenlampen Leidenschaft ist dies mein einziger Ausfall. Die Wettbewerbsmodelle machen nach wie vor uneingeschränkt Freude. Sie verrichten ihren Dienst bei Wanderungen und auf dem Fahrrad fehlerfrei und überzeugen nach wie vor durch enorme Lichtleistung, funktionales Handling und vor allem Zuverlässigkeit.

Mit der P12 dagegen verbinde ich eine große Enttäuschung und ich werde die Marke Nitecore bei weiteren Käufen wohl nicht mehr berücksichtigen. Die angebotene Produktqualität ist den Premiumpreis keinesfalls wert. Im Vergleich zu den anderen bereits genannten Herstellern fällt Nitecore ab.

Vor der unvermeidlichen P12-Verschrottung, wollte ich doch noch den Verkäufer um einen abschließenden Rat bitten.
Mit den Erfahrungen des KTL Store - NITECORE Exklusiv-Distributor Deutschland schließt sich der Kreis und das Thema ist abgehakt.
Der Einfachheit halber nachstehend der kurze Schriftwechsel:

""Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
am 26.04.2014 erwarb ich bei Ihnen u.a. eine NiteCore P12.
Obwohl nur sehr sporadisch genutzt, läßt sich die Lampe seit etwa einem halben Jahr nicht mehr einschalten. Beim leichten Eindrücken des Ein/Aus Schalters blitzt sie kurz auf, beim kompletten Drücken bleibt sie dunkel.
Bevor ich das Produkt jetzt endgültig entsorge und meine negative Erfahrung mitteile, wende ich mich an Sie: haben Sie einen Tipp zur Fehlerbehebung bzw. einen anderweitigen Lösungs- oder Reparaturvorschlag?
Herzlichen Dank für Ihre Antwort.
Freundliche Grüße,
...
PS: die zeitgleich bei Ihnen erworbene Fenix PD12 verrichtet trotz regelmäßiger Benutzung auf dem Fahrrad klaglos Ihren Dienst. Qualitätsproblem Nitecore?""

Hier die Antwort:

""Sehr geehrter Herr ...,
die Ursache der Fehlfunktion können wir natürlich aus der Entfernung nicht feststellen.
Wir hätten Ihnen gern auf Kulanz weitergeholfen. Allerdings hält uns Ihre unterschwellige Drohung davon ab.

Die Performance ist der Wahnsinn- meine alte Mag-Lite, die so lang ist wie mein Unterarm, wird von der kleinen Leuchte deutlich übertroffen. Ich betreibe sie mit dem Nitecore-Akku mit 2600mAh.
Nettes Feature anderen Lampen gegenüber ist die Restspannungsanzeige per Blink-Code des Schalters (z.B. 3,2V= *Blink* *Blink* *Blink* *PAUSE* *Blink* *Blink*). Zum Anzeigen der Restspannung müssen beide Schalter gleichzeitig gedrückt werden.
Als Bemerkung sind Hersteller wie z.B. LED Lenser zwar die Marktführer- technisch sind die Lampen z.B. dieser hier aber klar unterlegen- ich habe den direkten Vergleich zu einer P7.2...
Insgesamt klare Kaufempfehlung! Das qualitative Niveau der Nitecore Lampen liegt gleichauf mit Herstellern wie LED Lenser und Fenix.

441,R7GK9J2H33GN5,True,Spitzenklasse!,"*** Update nach 8 Monaten Verwendung: ***

Bin nach wie vor (relativ) zufrieden mit meiner P12, verwende sie fast nächtlich - allerdings mit Einschränkungen...
Vor Kurzem ist sie mir zum ersten Mal hinuntergefallen - aus ca. 1m auf Steinboden auf meiner Terrasse... ok, sie funktioniert noch, hat aber jetzt eine hässliche Delle am vorderen Ende, der Lack ist natürlich ab und man siehr das nackte Alu... also von wegen superharte überdrüber-Beschichtung..!! Sieht zwar wesentlich besser aus und fühlt sich besser an als bei Billiglampen oder manchen anderen Herstellern (zB meine Jetbeam ist relativ matt und rauh im Vergleich), aber hält auch nicht mehr aus. Weiters geht der Lack bei div. Stellen mit der Zeit ab, durch Abnutzung, zB im Bereich des Gürtelclip (angeblich titanbeschichteter Bereich - lol).

Also Fazit: gute Leistung, Akku hält rel. lange, aber istz und bleibt halt ein Chinaprodukt - verspricht seeehr viel, hält nicht alles.

*** Ursprüngliches Review: ***

Habe mich zur Anschaffung einer Hochleistungs-LED-Lampe entschlossen, quasi mein Einstieg in die Materie, aber sicher nicht meine letzte --- Achtung Sammler-Suchtgefahr!! Nach langer Überlegung habe ich mich für die Nitecore P12 entschieden. Habe sie jetzt seit 3 Wochen täglich verwendet und bin sehr zufrieden! Sehr zu empfehlen. Nicht billig, das Teil, dazu kommen noch ein 18650er Akku und ein Ladegerät, also in Summe knapp über 100€... aber wie gesagt, das wird nicht meine letzte LED sein...

Habe einige Lampen verglichen und jede Menge Reviews gelesen - unter denen, die bei uns hier problemlos erhältlich sind, ist die P-12 sicher eine Top-Wahl! Bes. vgl. mit dem (ehemaligen?) Platzhirsch Fenix PD-35, welche etwas schlechter abschneidet. Einziger Vorteil der PD35 aus meiner Sicht wäre die zusätzliche 5. Abstufung, aber sie hat auch div. Nachteile und ist obendrein etwas teurer. Im Nachhinein betrachtet wäre eine Lampe mit stufenloser Regulierung wie zB Nitecore SRT-5 oder die kleinere SRT-3 eine Alternative gewesen. Eine kleinere mit 1xCR-123 bzw Akku und optionaler 14500er-Extension kommt sicher noch ins Haus, dann aber stufenlos, zB eben die SRT-3, eine Jetbeam, Sunwayman o.Ä.!

Meine Bewertung der P-12:
+ super verarbeitet
+ enorme Reichweite
+ Akku-Ladestand jederzeit abrufbar
+ 1-Lumen-Firefly Modus
+ sehr handlich, griffig, schlank, passt super an den Gürtel oder in die Hosentasche, für taktische Anwendungen gut geeignet
+ Memory-Funktion (auch für Strobe)
+ Tail-Stand möglich
+ Zubehör ebenfalls gut verarbeitet
etc, etc---

einziges 'Minus':
- 'nur' 4 Leistungsstufen, rel. großer Sprung zw. 210Lm und 950Lm
- (ferner): Tactical Ring ist aus Plastik, passt nicht so Recht ins Gesamtbild

Beeindruckend ist die enorme Reichweite im Freien. Das Leuchtbild des Kegels ist sehr sauber und glar abgegrenzt, der Spill ist auch hell genug um die Umbegung ordentlich auszuleuchten. Die Lampe ist super mit einer Hand bedienbar - Daumen am Clicky und kleiner Finger am Selector, die andere Hand frei!
Jetzt muss unbedingt eine Fahrradhalterung her - freue mich schon, wenn mir dann wieder mal ein Autofahrer entgegen kommt der sein Fernlicht nicht abblendet, hehe! Der wird sein blaues Wunder erleben ;-)
