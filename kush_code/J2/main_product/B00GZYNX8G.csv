18,R3DXM8GPYSJU4T,False,A great light but get the Nitecore EC20 instead,"NOTE! THE THRUNITE 1050 Lumen flashlight is cheaper and just as good as this, or the Nitecore EC20, this P12 was great in its day (2013) but has since been outdone!Don't pay more than 60$ for this.

*Purchased from amazon.com via Harris Outdoors for 65$, I ordered it from the US to Canada, with shipping it ran me about 90$ total and I got a battery charger and 2 X 4000 mAh batteries in addition to the factory case and lanyard.

*Before I go into the review I have to say that of the 60 products I've reviewed on Amazon.ca this is by far the best product for the money. Just be careful as many places are overcharging for it, its going for 60-75$ US currency.

1) Lightweight. Lighter than many flashlights in its class, won't bog you down.

2) BRIGHT. Projects far and a narrow beam, but still has very good spill. For the size it is simply incredibly bright. I bought a 200 lumen surefire 6PX pro a couple years back and thought that was INSANE at the time, this light is simply bat&*^% CRAZY BRIGHT!!! Its amazing how far this light tech has come in just a 5 years.

3) Lanyard hole. This is a great feature not available on enough lights, it ensures you dont lose it if wrapped around wrist when in sketchy situations.

4) VERSATILE AS *&%!. It can be a tactical light if you want it to be, or set to start off on minimal brightness, its up to you.

5) Stands on butt end and head end.

6) SECURITY. With all high output lights with aluminum casing they can be used as a defensive weapon, this would temporarily blind someone in an instant, and act as a kubaton.

7) SHAPE. Not having a head that bulges out is a huge asset when pocketing it.

8) LONG LASTING. Even on the 1 lumen setting it is surprisingly bright and easily usable. Haven't tested the 520 hours promise but even if half of that its impressive.

9) STROBE OPTIONS. Hold down button to engage strobe, hold down again for shorter strobe (SOS MORSE CODE, and again for even shorter, but be warned this could light up a rave! JUST INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF OPTIONS!!!

10) TWO BUTTONS. The main one at butt end is your on/ off switch. The smaller one on the side controls the mode (it will save the mode you have it set at).

11) WONT TURN ON IN POCKET. The on/off switch is just under flush with butt end, it would be a rare situation that caused this light to turn on unintentionally.

12) MOLLE compatible sheath. Fits perfectly on the shoulder strap of a 5-11 tactical or equivalent MOLLE pack for easy but secure access. Sheath has a lengthy velcro flap that holds it securely no matter what the orientation.

CONS
*Not many but a few

1) GRIP ISSUES. Compared to other flashlight in its class the grip suffers a bit especially towards the head end where its a more sleek textured aluminum.",canada,"November 14, 2014",Canadian Prepper,5.0,16,2020-10-27 22:17:44.007009,2020-10-27 22:17:44.114115,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

25,R1SMQJ0RATAAA5,True,La piu potente torcia che io abbia mai utilizzato,"Il prodotto √® arrivato il mattino seguente all'ordine. L'imballo conteneva la versione nuova della P12 ovvero la versione da 1000 Lumen anche se l'articolo parla della versione da 950 che √® piu datata, la confezione contiene il manuale di istruzioni, di cui si pu√≤ fare anche a meno visto la semplicit√† d'uso, la clip metallica per fissare la torcia alla cintura, l'anello tattico per migliorare l'impugratura quando la si tiene nel pugno sopra la spalla, la cordina per legare la P12 al polso, una custodia che pu√≤ essere fissata alla cintura, due O-Ring di ricambio e un pulsante di accensione sostitutivo e il certificato di garanzia. Ho inserito nella torcia una batteria 18650 NON top di gamma, e utilizzando una batteria mediocre fa veramente molta luce, immagino quindi che con una batteria migliore che la luminosit√† sia ancora migliore. Il led √® molto stabile, non da sfarfallii e il raggio e la proiezione sono estremamente omogenei oltre al fatto che scalda veramente poco per utilizzare un LED da 10W di potenza massima, le 4 modalit√† di potenza poi sono molto utili se si sta lavorando e non si vuole accecarsi, √® infatti possibile abbassare il livello di luminosti√† a livelli intermedi, interessante poi la modalit√† Location Beacon che lancia un flash alla massima potenza disponibile ogni 3/4 secondi, utile per farsi individuare in condizioni estreme. Anche la modalit√† strobo ha la sua utilit√†, in caso di segnalazioni a distanza (per richiamare l'attenzione) o come difesa personale (l'uso della stroboscopica diretta disorienta temporaneamente), in ultima √® presente la modalit√† SOS che lancia un segnale morse luminoso (punto punto punto linea linea linea punto punto punto).

58,R2SNHDQKGUSSZ5,True,Migliore delle aspettative,"Ricevuta la versione P12 (CREE XM-L2 U2) del 2015 da 1000 lumens.
La torcia √® solida e facile da utilizzare. Ha 4 livelli di luminosit√† + strobo e SOS.
Da descrizioni riporta genericamente 1 ora e 15 minuti di durata a 1000 lumens con una batteria 18650 da 2600mh, l'ho subito testata a 1000 lumens con una ThruNite 3400mAh 18650 e dopo 3 ore e 1/2 era ancora accesa, scaldando veramente poco... molto pi√π di quanto mi sarei aspettato.

59,R2KN8PJBWNCSKX,True,Durchaus empfehlenswert!,"Ich nutze die Taschenlampe bei Nachtaktivit√§ten oder bei meinem Hobby. Dadurch dass die Taschenlampe ihre kompakte Form besitzt, ist sie optimal einsetzbar.

Die 1000 Lumen grenzen meiner Meinung nach schon fast an K√∂rperverletzung, aber ein normaler Mensch versucht damit ja nicht andere Menschen zu bel√§stigen. Die verschiedenen Modi funktionieren einwandfrei, die Taschenlampe hat 4 Helligkeitsstufen. Die Modi (Strobo/SOS) leuchten in vorgegebener Helligkeit (ich denke es liegt um die 750 Lumen).

Kleine bis mittlelgro√üe R√§ume werden komplett ausgeleuchtet wenn man die Taschenlampe einschaltet (bei 1000 Lumen). F√ºr Fabrikhallen ist sie durch ihre Leuchtreichweite auch geeignet; selbiges gilt f√ºr den Waldbereich. Meiner Meinung nach definitiv ihr Geld wert.",germany,"June 15, 2015",Bill Rawes,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:07.006244,2020-10-27 22:18:07.130912,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

69,R1JX9AKG4GC8LN,True,Genau das was ich gesucht habe,"Habe mich lange umgeschaut und endlich diese Taschenlampe gefunden. Eine Taschenlampe soll einfach nur hell strahlen. Ich verstehe nicht warum man so viele verschiedene Leuchtmodis braucht. Von wegen Stroboskop und und und... Diese hat 3 verschiedene Modis und die sind mehr als ausreichend.

Die Lichtst√§rke ist einfach nur extrem. Habe pers√∂nlich nichts helleres gesehen. Hier ist das Regeln der Lichtst√§rke √ºber dem Mode Button spitze.

70,R1BFLVVMSLJCUP,True,Licht!!!!!!!!!!!,wer sich entscheiden sollte diese Lampe zu kaufen sollte sich abgew√∂hnen andere Menschen mal so aus spass anzuleuchten.. Ja es ist Hell :-D die Lampe ist super war damit im Wald und habe sie ausf√ºrlich getestet. ich sehe keinen Grund diese Lampe nicht weiter zu empfehlen.. sie macht einen robusten eindruck und wer dann noch meckert es sei ihm zu dunkel .. der sollte dringend einen Augenarzt aufsuchen :-D der 1 Lumen Modus ist sehr gut... wenig verbrauch und man findet sich trotzdem zurecht :-) der Batterieanzeiger ist auch super alles in allen kann man Garnichts verkehrt machen;-) klares ja!!!

72,R1KOBE843ZNY75,True,PESSIMO SERVIZIO,"Ho acquistato questa torcia in quanto di mio interesse e molto potente.
Mi e' arrivata puntualmente, ma non funzionava. Cosi' ho chiesto ad Amazon la sostituzione.
Amazon ha prontamente inviato un altro pacco, arrivato il giorno dopo, ma conteneva una torcia identica USATA.
Si capiva dal fatto che: era graffiata, le istruzioni erano spiegazzate, la scatolina che la conteneva era rotta, mancava di altri oggetti
essenziali presenti pero' nella prima spedizione (come il laccetto, la clip a cintura, le guarnizioni,....).
Ho quindi chiesto nuovamente una sostituzione, ma Amazon mi ha risposto che trattandosi della seconda volta non la fara' ma procedera'
ad un rimborso.
Quindi ho perduto circa 10 giorni e mi dovro' rivolgere altrove.

80,R2TSQCXEEWR2XF,True,garbage,"This flashlight if it was made with quality components would be awesome. It's compact, bright, and on other than the highest setting, the battery lasts forever! However, this is the second one that I bought. The first one that I bought on ebay, lasted about ten months. I picked it up one day, and it only worked on the lowest setting which would be fine for reading a book at night or something like that. I wrote to Nitecore and they needed the serial number of it. Apparently they only warrant the light when you buy it from one of their dealers. After getting their response for their fix, (is the battery charged, is the cap on tight, is the battery good, etc). I figured that it was a fluke. I got tired of their nonsense and ordered another one from Amazon. One month later....guess what happened! The same exact thing. This company charges premium price for something very unreliable. After being questioned like I was an invalid with the first light, I assumed that this wasn't a normal problem. The purchase of the second light with the identical problem a month after purchase, tells me that this is common place, and unless you pay upwards of $100, this company will not warrant their product!
I'm going to attempt to send them back to Nite Core to see if they will repair them and what their charge would be.

83,R6606EDN607NU,True,The sweet spot of camping and outdoor flashlight design.,"Now my favorite light. I have a dozen or more tactical lights, two of which are Nitecores.
Holster is first class, very heavy nylon webbing. It has a Velcro closure that allows you to put this over a belt, without taking the belt off. You can also thread your belt thru a loop that is sewn to the holster. It also has a D hook for attaching this to a pack.

Flashlight is powered by a 18650 battery or the CR123s. Low is 1 lumen, perfect for use at night, bathroom trips, etc. Will not blow out your night vision. Beam is not overly broad, or laser focused. Perfect. Turob is as expected, turns my back yard into daytime. I have a P30 that has a laser focused beam--good to play around with-search for wildlife etc, but overall not that useful. This will be my carry flashlight in camp, and outdoor excursions as the beam width is just right. For me it is too big for an EDC. I would use my AA for that. Its a bit on the heavy side, as expected for a well built 18650.

I would never again buy a light that does not have a tailswitch as the on/off switch. [Their EC20 is without a tailswitch, and you have to unscrew the base to carry it in your pocket] This P12 also has a clip, which prevents it from dropping all the way to the bottom of your pocket. Pretty darn near perfect.

87,R1MZ9NX9JY7NTK,True,Love this Nitecore,"I am pleased with the Nitecore P12 2015 tactical light. Slightly before buying this light I bought a Vizeri 460. In comparing them I was somewhat surprised that when focused for throw the Vizeri would illuminate better at a distance than the Nitecore. Testing both at high setting shining into my eyes to simulate blinding an attacker, I found that the 460 lumen Vizeri was just as blinding as the Nitecore. And the Vizeri is a fair amount cheaper.

So why the 5 stars for this Nitecore in light of the foregoing (pun intended): its construction is a bit better, as evidenced by the smoothness of threading the end cap on with both lights treated with silicone lubricant, it is thinner and has a sturdy belt clip - important factors for EDC, has a body component that impedes rolling when laid horizontally on a table surface, can measure battery strength and will automatically warn with light signals when the battery is getting low, and a crenelated end for use when engaging with an attacker is not avoidable (do just escape rather than engage if at all possible). These factors make me pleased with the Nitecore, despite the fact that for blinding brightness the two lights seem to be about equal.

Oh, just so you know, you don't get the 5 year warranty buying though Amazon that a purchase from a certified Nitecore dealer would enable, but in exchange for that loss the price here is about $10 less.",the united states,"June 17, 2016",exrelayman,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:20.030331,2020-10-27 22:18:20.151879,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

88,R5TA578MHPC5J,True,"So far it's great! UPDATE 9 months, broken","UPDATE: I don't use the light a lot so I got 9 months out of it before it freaked out and won't go brighter than lowest dim setting. If I leave it alone for a few hours, it seems to work, then it stops functioning correctly after 5 minutes or so. I've changed batteries. I've put in new CR123s ( since it stopped working with ALL my rechargeable 18650 batteries). Will not buy Nitecore again.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: So far it's great! After buying several tactical lights from some other manufacturers and being disappointed, I did research and I bought this Nitecore light. I like the weight, the functions, the button operation, and the brightness. No lab tests but testing in my back yard I can see distant objects slightly better with my Olight 900 lumen light, but I still prefer the Nitecore to that one. The very slight brightness difference is hard to notice and there are other factors that make the Nitecore a better buy.

A couple years ago I bought an Olight tactical LED that was 320 lumens and I really liked it. It lasted and performed well, so I bought its big brother when I wanted a brighter one. Unfortunately the new 900 lumen Olight has a really lame/unreliable way to cycle through the brightness levels by twisting the flashlight head, which started to become unreliable after a couple months. Around that same time the original Olight I liked started to short out and flicker a lot. Olights have proven unreliable over time, so I hope Nitecore's quality reputation over time, matches the initial strong performance.",the united states,"September 7, 2015",Larry B,1.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:20.156872,2020-10-27 22:18:20.283773,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I have absolutely zero complaints to the form and function of this flashlight, the problem is the design of the internals.

Due to it's all metal construction, this light is pretty heavy for it's size, if you drop it once (which you're bound to do if you're actually using the light) even from about 3ft, you might wreck the internal components.

I have gone through about 4 of these things in 2 years.. I keep buying them because they're great lights, but one maybe two drops and that's it.. they're done. On 2 of the lights, the little plastic circular thing and the battery lead on the bulb module have broken off completely rendering it useless. The other 2 lights remained intact but they simply stopped working after accidental drops from a relatively low height.

All that being said, this is still the best light for the price and as long as you realize it's fragile nature and are willing to risk it, it's worth the price for it's function.. in fact I just replaced another one.. again.. for the 5th time.",the united states,"June 16, 2019",AR305,2.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:20.298732,2020-10-27 22:18:20.427117,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The light is slim and can fit in just about any pocket of your pants.

99,R14N42V03R55P6,True,Good light for the money,"I compared a Nitecore P12 to a Shadowhawk X800, which is in about the same price range, & reached the following conclusions.

Advantages of the Nitecore P12: Much brighter, more modes, longer-lasting batteries (two CR123s or one 18650 rechargeable), more watertight, smaller & lighter, low-battery indicator, comes with holster & pocket clip.

Advantages of the Shadowhawk X800: adjustable beam width, less expensive batteries (three AAAs).

I prefer the separate on/off & mode-switching buttons of the P12 (on/off on the end cap, mode-switching on the side, perfectly placed for thumb operation) to the single end-cap button that does everything on the X800. I suppose that's a judgment call. The only reason I can imagine for choosing the X800 would be if adjustable beam width overrides all other performance criteria, in which case you may not need a tactical flashlight.

Bottom line: If you're in the market for a tactical flashlight in this price range, you could do worse than the Nitecore P12.",the united states,"June 30, 2016",Grandpa,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:26.777640,2020-10-27 22:18:26.897359,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

100,RJ3NGYIETMIOF,True,The holster doesn't seem like standard MOLLE but it gets the job done on ...,"I've tried a bunch of other flashlights but this is now my EDC. The lowest setting throws just enough light to see your immediate surroundings in the dark but not bright enough to ruin night vision. The highest setting is startlingly bright and results in a VERY hot emitter (there's a sticker warning of that fact and it's no joke). There are two additional intermediate settings that will probably get the most use. The holster doesn't seem like standard MOLLE but it gets the job done on the pack or on a belt. The included wrist lanyard works, I guess, but it does get in the way unless you're sure to use it every time.

Since it doesn't work on standard alkaline batteries, I recommend getting at least 2 quality 18650 Li-Ion batteries and a decent charger.

102,R12S5EY2CG46E9,True,Seems like a nice flashlight,"Seems like a nice flashlight, but I'm having an issue. I'm using Panasonic 18650 batteries and the flashlight will operate intermittently unless I really (and I mean really) tighten everything down. If the tail cap is the slightest bit loose, the flashlight will turn off and on just by setting it down, banging it on my hand, etc. Is this normal? Every other flashlight I've had with a screw-on tail cap had some range with backing it out before the flashlight turned off. On this P12, it happens pretty much immediately, like in less than 1/8th of a turn.

I tried sending Nitecore a message first, but all I got was a big red ""X"" after I hit the submit button.

Dropped my review to two stars because the low power indicator is not accurate at all. It's supposed to start slow flashing once every two seconds when the battery gets to 50% discharged, which is about 3.80-3.85V.

105,R3EWHJ6EWSDO3N,True,The 1000 lumen setting is very bright and focused,"I've owned the P12 for over 2 years and would easily recommend. The 1000 lumen setting is awesome, but it gets hot and consumes battery life, and yet for those times when you want to see some distant spot, it's simply incredible that you get to see so much more than you thought possible with a flashlight. The 240 lumen setting is still very bright and in my case, the most used which will still get you about 20 hrs of battery life. The 70 lumen is barely adequate by today's standards, but it's still better than most incandescent bulky flashlights. The 1 lumen setting is hardly perceptible, which has created situations in where I thought the light was off, it wasn't, thus stored it only to eventually find I had a dead battery (remember to use the tail switch for on and off). This Nitecore light version does not come with batteries so I purchased (2) 18650 rechargeable batteries and rotate them so that when needed, I have one battery with a full charge. This P12 Nitecore has become our ""go to"" flashlight in our household. I liked it so much that I went on to purchase a second for our car. It is compact, lightweight, extremely bright and reliable so that wherever I go, I can see my surroundings well. Nitecore is manufactured in China and that's where their support is located. That said, they're on China time and response is slow and very underwhelming, hence the 4 star.

106,R1KN27ZB4SIR9B,True,Great light. Would buy again,"Cons:
- does not include batteries (takes 18650s)
- no charge port, so you'll need to buy a charger
- no battery charge indicator
Pros:
- Lighter and more comfortable to use than similar spec'd Streamlight
- Good value for lumens @ 1000 for $42
- Has a great throw with about a 8-10"" hot spot
- Really good mAH efficiency
- Fits well in your pocket
- Should make a great gun light considering the low weight

I work in the power industry where a good flashlight is a must. I need a light that penetrates the suspended ash and coal dust in the air, gummed up sightglasses and far off objects.

I gave 5 stars for functionality, efficiency and ease of use. At the end of the day that's all that really matters.
I've owned 5 or 6 different lights including a couple of Streamlights. The SLs are great but I prefer this nitecore because it is more efficient. It does a good job of managing its energy.

108,RUU3KQ6FK1MO0,True,Good value at this price,"Compared to the similar Fenix PD35, this light acquits itself rather well, at a price $30 less than the fenix. Slightly less robust construction and a lower quality tailswitch than the fenix (spongy and gritty compared to the Fenix), but overall good performance, and side/mode switch has better tactile accessibility than the equivalent switch on the fenix. Overall a good tradeoff vs the fenix... significantly lower price, yet acceptably lower quality. This presumes that the yet-to-be-determined reliability and longevity of the Nitecore will be comparable to the Fenix. What is notable is that the Nitecore was clearly designed with the use of a 18650 cell in mind --- the cell is a perfect fit, with adequate clearance radially and axially. (This is using an Orbtronics 3400 maH). In contrast, the same 18650 is a tight fit in the Fenix, and the added length compared to 2XCR123 makes for added compression stress on the tailcap spring. Odd, when it's considered that the 18650 is the power supply means recommended by Fenix.

116,R36DUD2XJQMFEF,True,Awesome everyday carry light but customer support is lacking,"This is a great flashlight. It's mostly well made and produces outstanding light from a 18650 rechargeable battery. I've owned this product for about 5 months. However, after 5 months of use the circuit has broken and now it only lights up in low mode which is good enough for reading and that's about it.
I have tried contacting Nitecore but they don't have a USA customer support line so you have to email them and wait for a response. Most likely I will have to RMA and ship this back to China which will likely be a month journey or more. The timing is terrible since it's now fall and I need a flashlight now more so than during the summer. I would recommend this flashlight with some reservation because of the lack of quick customer support. Other manufactures have a dedicated US phone line to call. It's still a great light and I do recommend it.

119,R16YH67IUBUMV8,True,Saves my life several times per week,"My friends think I'm crazy, because during the summer months I hike the desert mountains around Phoenix at night. That's good because it cools down to a balmy 100 degrees. That's bad because rattlesnakes come at dusk as the evening ""cools"". Fortunately for me, the flashlight beam is the perfect blend of diffuse and spot lighting to be perfect for trail hiking. That's really important because the beam isn't adjustable, which keeps the size and weight down. It also feels great in your hand and comes with an adjustable wrist lanyard. The selectable levels of brightness can positively light up the night. It's so bright I rarely use the brightest level. I generally keep it on level two or three depending upon how much natural moonlight there is. This flashlight allows me to see every spider, cliff-edge, coyote, cholla, scorpion, and rattlesnake so that I can avoid them all.

If you're still reading I assume you're really interested in this flashlight. My other tip to you is to buy a charger and rechargeable batteries. I bought the Nitecore D4 Smart Charger and a set of Nitecore 3400mAh 18650 batteries. The disposable CR123A batteries (it takes two) work just fine. However, the rechargeable 18650 battery (it's longer so you only need one) seems to last much longer. It's not an obvious feature on the flashlight, but if you hold down the brightness selection button when you turn the flashlight on, the selection button will blink a bright blue light indicating the voltage remaining in the battery. Three blinks, followed by a pause, and then two more blinks indicate the battery has dropped to 3.2V (+/- 0.1V). So it's easy to know when it's time to recharge. I always carry two P12 flashlights on my night hikes, one as my main light and the other as a fully-charged backup.",the united states,"August 23, 2015",M.

120,R2VU1IY0Y0CH68,True,This is my go-to EDC light and the best flashlight I have ever owned,"I am a psychiatric RN and have had the Nitecore P12 by my side for about 1.5 years now doing night shifts. This is my go-to EDC light and the best flashlight I have ever owned. I am most impressed with its build quality, overall very solid and it just feels like it will last a long time. The rubber switches have good tactile and audible feedback when pressed. The light offers 4 light settings and SOS/Strobe modes are a bonus. I find myself using 70/240 lumen settings most often, but love having the 1000 lumens just in case. The brightness level is great and really more than enough for my type of use.

The flashlight does stand so you can set it down have your hands free with the room lit. The base of the light is also solid metal and could be used to defend yourself. I am using Edison Brite 18650 batteries and usually charge every 3-4 weeks. The light sees about 12hrs of use/week with 70% usage in 70 lumen mode, and 30% alternating between 240 and 1000 lumen modes.

The one negative I can dock on this flashlight is when using 1000 lumen mode for over 1 minute, the light gets warm and after 3 minutes of use, it gets quite hot. According to the specs, it says the light can run 1000 lumen mode for 1hr and 15 minutes. I couldn't imagine running it at that setting for that long as it would get way too hot.

PROs:
-solid construction
-convenient light output settings
-SOS and strobe settings
-can stand
-long battery life

CONs:
hot on 1000 lumen mode",the united states,"January 13, 2017",OGpedRN,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:18:35.816180,2020-10-27 22:18:35.991532,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I thought this one would be perfect for backpacking/camping, etc because of the compact size. The light is extremely bright, seemed durable and well constructed. I liked it a lot until . . .

About 6 months after purchase the brightness mode button stopped working - instead of multiple modes, I only got dim or medium brightness. Now, a little more than a year later, the light won't even turn on. I tried multiple battery configurations (rechargeable, standard lithium, etc). When I looked up the issue, I noticed that there are multiple 1-star ratings for this light for the same reasons. Lesson learned: no more Nitecore.

I buy LED flashlights for three reasons: brightness, reliability and durability (no filament in an LED). This light is nothing more than a paperweight after a little more than a year of very occasional use.

206,R1C8CCY5LIKIO8,True,In a word: UltraFantasticallyAwesome,"I bought this light for my brother's birthday in May, and he absolutely loved it. At the same time I ordered a Surefire 6PX Pro for myself, and on comparison, the Nightcore has much nicer machining of the body. There were tool marks on the Surefire that gave it a bit of a cheaper feel than my previous 6P model that I bought back in the Military.

Anyway, one of the things I love about this light compared to the Surefire 6PX Pro is that the Nitecore has a glass or mineral crystal lens, instead of the plastic one on the Surefire. After cleaning the lens on my Surefire once it developed annoying swirl marks that the Nitecore won't be susceptible to.

Out of the box, the Nitecore feels like a normal tactical flashlight should. I've been using Tac-lights in the Military since 2004, so I'm pretty familiar with their construction and operation at this point. The box comes with a bunch of accessories and spare parts, such as replacement O-rings and spare tail cap button. This is a very nice touch, and shows that Nitecore is serious about the long-term wear of their product.

The user interface of this light is fantastic. The last brightness level is remembered at power-on, so there is no need to annoyingly cycle through levels by pressing the tail-cap multiple times (looking at you, Surefire). There is a blue LED that blinks when the batteries are getting low, and also a nice feature where if you hold the mode button and tail-cap button at the same time, the battery voltage is displayed through a series of blinks. This is a very nice touch.

So far, I'm really impressed. This light is noticeably brighter than the Surefire, offering 4 brightness settings compared to two, and also the epilepsy-inducing ""seizure mode"", SOS and location beacon modes that can be activated by holding down the mode button.

The only real negative is the batteries fit a bit loose inside the barrel. I'm using the CR123s, so the other battery option might fit tighter.

Also, the head of the light gets really hot after running in turbo mode for a few minutes. The hotness isn't a negative though, as any high-powered flashlight with this output is going to create the same heat. It won't burn you, but it does get very warm on it's highest setting. Just expect that.

So impressed was I by this light that I ordered one for myself which came today. Same quality and construction as my brother's, so I am very pleased.",the united states,"August 11, 2014",Zachary Sandberg,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:19:14.080871,2020-10-27 22:19:14.231632,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

214,R1PSGNK506KK01,True,"Great Light, Very Bright, Lots of Features","Just got this for the last mission trip for Haiti. It's a bit large to EDC in your pocket, but worked great on our trip. (My fav. EDC is super-handy LRI Proton, which throws a crazy beam from one AA battery). This torch lights up the night and has plenty of spill so you can get a good swath of light, even on the lower settings. On full, it's pretty blinding. With the 18650 rechargeable battery, it has even more capacity and you don't feel bad about buying those fairly expensive 123 batteries. For car or mobile use, I keep a pair of the 123s as backup, and one rechargeable batter near the charger so I can switch out as needed and keep a freshly charged one in the light. On the trip, the ability to tailstand was important as we had a few nights with no electricity and this, aimed at the ceiling was our room light. Also love the voltage indicator via the lighted switch (it flashes a number of times to indicate the current voltage) and that it also indicates low voltage with intermittent flashes. Two things I'd like even better, if it had a more focused beam, but that's hard to do without this style of reflector. Also, love the Four Sevens interface where you can give the head a half twist to access high beam and strobe and would love to see that on this light. Finally, the ""moonbeam"" setting is great for minimal light needed-tasks and for extending several hundred hours of light on one charge/set of batteries).

But it does get hot after a few mins when put on the highest setting. I am using the large 3400ma batteries at 18.3mm diameter, so it'll take the ""big"" batteries. But the anode cap won't reach the contact on the back of the bulb, so i put a small neodymuim magnet I had 4.78mm x 4.7 cylinder i had lying around, and that solved my problem. I believe that the other ppl that have had this unit fail after a time are leaving them on the high setting and letting them ""burn up"" or letting the led material melt, and that is the reason they fail. This does get very hot on the high setting. If it was intended to stay there for more than about 10 mins, they would have put a ""heat sink"" on it to cool it. If you need 900 lumens for more time than 10 mins, you need a lantern. and the 500 lumen setting is sufficient for most needs.

Working the nightshift, having a reliable flashlight could mean the difference of you going or not going home. I personally own 2-Nitecore SRT-7's. (One for work and the other as a EDC) I really trust the brand.
Recently my previous generation P12 stopped working for no apparent reason. I have since been intouch with Nitecore and they have advised me to contact the original seller who is independent from Amazon to rectify this issue. I've done that and the case is still on going.
So far, I like the 2015 P12 but I like the previous generation because of the much longer throw. From the first time I turned this new 2015 P12 on I immediately knew that the throw was significantly less. I would still highly recommend this flashlight even though I had a issue with my last one for no apparent reason. As a EDC OR CAMPING FLASHLIGHT ..... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

Additionally I added on the Nitecore i2 Intellicharger (which also shows batteries in the picture but were not included). Now I have approximately $70+ tied up in a flashlight that is inoperable! In order to get to a place where I can actually use & evaluate this light I had to spend an additional $37 for the batteries that work both in the light & the charger.

Secondly, one of the two P12s I just ordered had a faulty on/off switch.

So i did further research and discovered this light needs proprietary batteries, ergo, they're prohibitively priced. The light itself was a deal, I thought, for a 1000 lumen light, but when the batteries are $19 a piece, from Amazon and Battery junction, I said ""nope, you're going back where you came from"", and sent it back the same afternoon.

Die Wahl fiel auf Grund der vorhandenen sehr guten Rezensionen auf die P12. Sie hat rund ein Jahr lang fast t√§glich auch klaglos ihren Dienst verrichtet - und wurde dabei zugegebenerma√üen nicht geschont, aber auch mechanisch nicht sonderlich belastet.

Nach Ablauf des Jahres brach der Abstandshalter am unteren Ende der Akkuaufnahme. An sich kein Beinbruch, denn die Lampe funktioniert auch ohne. Eine genaue Ursache konnte ich nicht ausmachen, vermute aber, dass der nur lose eingelegte, schw√§chliche Plastikring sich beim Einlegen des Akkus verkantete und dabei besch√§digt wurde. Gravierender war ein etwas sp√§ter auftretender Wackelkontakt, der das Einschalten der Lampe verhinderte. Urs√§chlich ist nicht der sonst √ºbliche Verd√§chtige - der Schalter, Das Problem liegt irgendwo in der Elektronik des Lampenkopfes, die nicht zug√§nglich ist. Lie√ü sich das anf√§nglich noch durch Klopfen an die Lampe beseitigen, ging nat√ºrlich kurze Zeit sp√§ter gar nichts mehr.

Folgerichtig an den Anbieter als Gew√§hrleistungsfall gesendet. Heute kam das P√§ckchen als nicht zustellbar zur√ºck. Aber das ist ja nicht dem Hersteller anzulasten.

Die Fenix PD35 bleibt mein pers√∂nlicher Favorit, hier sch√§tze ich besonders das hervorragende Lichtbild (eher warmwei√ües Licht, sehr gelungene Abstimmung Flood/Throw) und die absolut makellose Bedienung √ºber den pr√§zisen Seitenschalter mit seinen knackigen Druckpunkten und den sehr sinnvoll abgestimmten Leuchtmodi.
Die Olight Modelle punkten mit einzigartiger Kompaktheit, womit man deren Premiumpreis rechtfertigen kann.

Die Nitecore P12 sah ich auf einer Stufe mit der Thrunite TN12 (Modelle 2014 und 2016). Ein Vorteil gegen√ºber den nur halb so teuren Thrunites war f√ºr mich die Ladestandsanzeige der P12.
Auch die neuen g√ºnstigen Modelle wie die Thorfire TK155, die Atactical A1S oder die Sofirn SP32 halten mit - allerdings habe ich da noch keine l√§ngeren Erfahrungswerte. Allemal beeindruckend finde ich die Tatsache, dass man sich zum Preis einer Nitecore P12 diese drei Modelle zusammen zulegen kann.

Jetzt aber zur eigentlichen Kritik an der P12:

Mit den von mir favorisierten Panasonic Akkus NCR18650B (ungesch√ºtzt) konnte ich die Lampe √ºberhaupt nicht betreiben - im Gegensatz zu allen anderen besteht sie auf einen erhabenen Pluspol. Also f√ºr 19 Euro noch einen entsprechenden Akku angeschafft - zuerst Olight dann sp√§ter nochmal Nitecore. √Ñrgerlich aber na gut...

Und obwohl ich die P12 nur sporadisch nutzte, traten bereits nach kurzer Zeit 'Aussetzer' auf. Manchmal lie√ü sie sich erst nach mehrmaligem Bet√§tigen des Heckschalters einschalten, manchmal fing das Licht an zu flackern und ging sogar ab und zu ganz aus. Leichtes R√ºtteln oder seitliches Klopfen des Lampenkopfes in der Hand half meist weiter.

Nach 2 1/2 Jahren ging dann irgendwann gar nichts mehr. Zwar blitzte das Teil beim Eindr√ºcken des Heckknopfes noch kurz auf, Einschalten gelang aber nicht mehr. Ein- oder zweimal startete noch der Strobe-Modus, den konnte man aber nicht verlassen.

Um es kurz zu machen: die Nitecore P12 konnte mich von Beginn an nicht begeistern, zum Schluss habe ich mich sogar monatelang immer wieder damit rumge√§rgert.

In 5 Jahren LED-Taschenlampen Leidenschaft ist dies mein einziger Ausfall. Die Wettbewerbsmodelle machen nach wie vor uneingeschr√§nkt Freude. Sie verrichten ihren Dienst bei Wanderungen und auf dem Fahrrad fehlerfrei und √ºberzeugen nach wie vor durch enorme Lichtleistung, funktionales Handling und vor allem Zuverl√§ssigkeit.

Mit der P12 dagegen verbinde ich eine gro√üe Entt√§uschung und ich werde die Marke Nitecore bei weiteren K√§ufen wohl nicht mehr ber√ºcksichtigen. Die angebotene Produktqualit√§t ist den Premiumpreis keinesfalls wert. Im Vergleich zu den anderen bereits genannten Herstellern f√§llt Nitecore ab.

Vor der unvermeidlichen P12-Verschrottung, wollte ich doch noch den Verk√§ufer um einen abschlie√üenden Rat bitten.
Mit den Erfahrungen des KTL Store - NITECORE Exklusiv-Distributor Deutschland schlie√üt sich der Kreis und das Thema ist abgehakt.
Der Einfachheit halber nachstehend der kurze Schriftwechsel:

""Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
am 26.04.2014 erwarb ich bei Ihnen u.a. eine NiteCore P12.
Obwohl nur sehr sporadisch genutzt, l√§√üt sich die Lampe seit etwa einem halben Jahr nicht mehr einschalten. Beim leichten Eindr√ºcken des Ein/Aus Schalters blitzt sie kurz auf, beim kompletten Dr√ºcken bleibt sie dunkel.
Bevor ich das Produkt jetzt endg√ºltig entsorge und meine negative Erfahrung mitteile, wende ich mich an Sie: haben Sie einen Tipp zur Fehlerbehebung bzw. einen anderweitigen L√∂sungs- oder Reparaturvorschlag?
Herzlichen Dank f√ºr Ihre Antwort.
Freundliche Gr√º√üe,
...

""Sehr geehrter Herr ...,
die Ursache der Fehlfunktion k√∂nnen wir nat√ºrlich aus der Entfernung nicht feststellen.
Wir h√§tten Ihnen gern auf Kulanz weitergeholfen. Allerdings h√§lt uns Ihre unterschwellige Drohung davon ab.

Top-Leuchte, liegt gut in der Hand, durchdachtes Schaltkonzept. Und die Lampe merkt sich den Strobe-Effekt als letzten Modus auch. Das war kaufentscheidend. Hatte mal eine Leuchte, von Fenix, bei der man nach dem Einschalten des Lichtes erst eine Sekunde die Taste halten musste, um den Strobe zu aktivieren.
Stellt euch folgende Situation vor: Geld am Geldautomaten geholt, b√∂ser Mensch will euch euer hart erarbeitetes Geld wegnehmen, ihr ziehe die Taschenlampe und sagt: ""Moment, in einer Sekunde gehts weiter - dann bitte hierher schauen.""

439,R3T8S8K9MN2DO1,True,Nitecore Pro P12,"Ich bin vorweg sehr zufrieden mit der Taschenlampe- super Verarbeitung und Zubeh√∂r (Tasche, Clip, Ersatzdichtungen und Schalterkappe mit dabei). Die Performance ist der Wahnsinn- meine alte Mag-Lite, die so lang ist wie mein Unterarm, wird von der kleinen Leuchte deutlich √ºbertroffen. Ich betreibe sie mit dem Nitecore-Akku mit 2600mAh.
Nettes Feature anderen Lampen gegen√ºber ist die Restspannungsanzeige per Blink-Code des Schalters (z.B. 3,2V= *Blink* *Blink* *Blink* *PAUSE* *Blink* *Blink*). Zum Anzeigen der Restspannung m√ºssen beide Schalter gleichzeitig gedr√ºckt werden.
Als Bemerkung sind Hersteller wie z.B. LED Lenser zwar die Marktf√ºhrer- technisch sind die Lampen z.B. dieser hier aber klar unterlegen- ich habe den direkten Vergleich zu einer P7.2...
Insgesamt klare Kaufempfehlung! Das qualitative Niveau der Nitecore Lampen liegt gleichauf mit Herstellern wie LED Lenser und Fenix.

441,R7GK9J2H33GN5,True,Spitzenklasse!,"*** Update nach 8 Monaten Verwendung: ***

Bin nach wie vor (relativ) zufrieden mit meiner P12, verwende sie fast n√§chtlich - allerdings mit Einschr√§nkungen...
Vor Kurzem ist sie mir zum ersten Mal hinuntergefallen - aus ca. 1m auf Steinboden auf meiner Terrasse... ok, sie funktioniert noch, hat aber jetzt eine h√§ssliche Delle am vorderen Ende, der Lack ist nat√ºrlich ab und man siehr das nackte Alu... also von wegen superharte √ºberdr√ºber-Beschichtung..!! Sieht zwar wesentlich besser aus und f√ºhlt sich besser an als bei Billiglampen oder manchen anderen Herstellern (zB meine Jetbeam ist relativ matt und rauh im Vergleich), aber h√§lt auch nicht mehr aus. Weiters geht der Lack bei div. Stellen mit der Zeit ab, durch Abnutzung, zB im Bereich des G√ºrtelclip (angeblich titanbeschichteter Bereich - lol).

Also Fazit: gute Leistung, Akku h√§lt rel. lange, aber istz und bleibt halt ein Chinaprodukt - verspricht seeehr viel, h√§lt nicht alles.

*** Urspr√ºngliches Review: ***

Habe mich zur Anschaffung einer Hochleistungs-LED-Lampe entschlossen, quasi mein Einstieg in die Materie, aber sicher nicht meine letzte --- Achtung Sammler-Suchtgefahr!! Nach langer √úberlegung habe ich mich f√ºr die Nitecore P12 entschieden. Habe sie jetzt seit 3 Wochen t√§glich verwendet und bin sehr zufrieden! Sehr zu empfehlen. Nicht billig, das Teil, dazu kommen noch ein 18650er Akku und ein Ladeger√§t, also in Summe knapp √ºber 100‚Ç¨... aber wie gesagt, das wird nicht meine letzte LED sein...

Habe einige Lampen verglichen und jede Menge Reviews gelesen - unter denen, die bei uns hier problemlos erh√§ltlich sind, ist die P-12 sicher eine Top-Wahl! Bes. vgl. mit dem (ehemaligen?) Platzhirsch Fenix PD-35, welche etwas schlechter abschneidet. Einziger Vorteil der PD35 aus meiner Sicht w√§re die zus√§tzliche 5. Abstufung, aber sie hat auch div. Nachteile und ist obendrein etwas teurer. Im Nachhinein betrachtet w√§re eine Lampe mit stufenloser Regulierung wie zB Nitecore SRT-5 oder die kleinere SRT-3 eine Alternative gewesen. Eine kleinere mit 1xCR-123 bzw Akku und optionaler 14500er-Extension kommt sicher noch ins Haus, dann aber stufenlos, zB eben die SRT-3, eine Jetbeam, Sunwayman o.√Ñ.!

Meine Bewertung der P-12:
+ super verarbeitet
+ enorme Reichweite
+ Akku-Ladestand jederzeit abrufbar
+ 1-Lumen-Firefly Modus
+ sehr handlich, griffig, schlank, passt super an den G√ºrtel oder in die Hosentasche, f√ºr taktische Anwendungen gut geeignet
+ Memory-Funktion (auch f√ºr Strobe)
+ Tail-Stand m√∂glich
+ Zubeh√∂r ebenfalls gut verarbeitet
etc, etc---

einziges 'Minus':
- 'nur' 4 Leistungsstufen, rel. gro√üer Sprung zw. 210Lm und 950Lm
- (ferner): Tactical Ring ist aus Plastik, passt nicht so Recht ins Gesamtbild

Beeindruckend ist die enorme Reichweite im Freien. Das Leuchtbild des Kegels ist sehr sauber und glar abgegrenzt, der Spill ist auch hell genug um die Umbegung ordentlich auszuleuchten. Die Lampe ist super mit einer Hand bedienbar - Daumen am Clicky und kleiner Finger am Selector, die andere Hand frei!
Jetzt muss unbedingt eine Fahrradhalterung her - freue mich schon, wenn mir dann wieder mal ein Autofahrer entgegen kommt der sein Fernlicht nicht abblendet, hehe! Der wird sein blaues Wunder erleben ;-)

Ich werde die Bewertung nach l√§ngerer Verwendung in ein paar Monaten updaten, hoffentlich bleibt's bei 5 Sternen!",germany,"January 16, 2014",Fan,3.0,0,2020-10-27 22:21:25.202595,2020-10-27 22:21:25.344214,"NiteCore P12 2015 Version 1000 Lumens Precise Tactical Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Waterproof Flashlight, Black",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZYNX8G,,"#137,329 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
