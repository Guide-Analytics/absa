1,R2RCAI2ICKW6J9,True,Overheats in HIGH MODE and will not shut off!,"I usually do not write reviews on the products I purchase from AMAZON, but figured this flashlight is worth saving others these possible headaches I have had with the pen light. 2 issues, one is the pocket clip, it had very little pocket retention out of the box and bent to easily when snagged which then allows the light to fall right out of my pocket. Second issue is an overheating issue. The light gets VERY hot in HIGH mode then it will not shut off with the tail cap switch.. The only way to shut it off then is by twisting the bezel to disconnect the battery. In high mode the light is very hot in under 2 minutes and will not function correctly due to overheating. Other than those 2 issues the light output is good and white.
For the cost of this light you would think the quality would be much better. I'm currently testing LUX-PRO series of pen lights and they are great, and at less than $14 are a MUCH BETTER alternative.

Very disappointed in this nitecore light as I have a lot of other nitecore products that perform well.",the united states,"July 26, 2018",John,2.0,0,2020-11-12 14:55:55.626972,2020-11-12 14:55:55.855882,"Nitecore MT06MD 180 Lumen Nichia LED Medical Penlight Flashlight For Doctors, Nurses and EMTs with 2x AAA Batteries & Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer (Black w/Pupil Gauge)",4.3,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B074X8YXT7,,"#524,911 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2,R36UH0ET43B381,True,great medical penlight but needs stronger clip,"I am an EMT student and bought this flashlight for skills labs and clinical use. I looked at a lot of cheaper ones but loved the fact that this flashlight has different brightness settings, so I'm never blinding anyone with a bright LED. It is also nice because it was recommended that we carry a flashlight along with our penlight, but this is certainly bright enough that I don't need a separate light. I haven't used it enough to attest to battery life, but I love that it comes with a case to carry backup batteries. I deducted a star because the clip is not as solid as I would like. After several weeks of clipping it to the side pocket on my EMT pants the clip bent just enough that it no longer securely holds to my pants and I occasionally have it fall out. I don't want to lose this light so I clip it to a pocket inside my pocket, but that's way more inconvenient when I am with a patient and need it quickly.",the united states,"November 1, 2017",TheLonelySoles,4.0,0,2020-11-12 14:55:55.866489,2020-11-12 14:55:56.123244,"Nitecore MT06MD 180 Lumen Nichia LED Medical Penlight Flashlight For Doctors, Nurses and EMTs with 2x AAA Batteries & Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer (Black w/Pupil Gauge)",4.3,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B074X8YXT7,,"#524,911 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I'd feel bad giving it two stars, but it's honestly at like a 2.5 for me right now. The clip on it couldn't hold onto a shirt/FRC pocket if it's existence depended on it. It falls out of my pocket constantly. If you bend over or have to move around randomly and want to rely on this thing being easily accessible, it's just not going to work out well for you.

4,R3NV74EXIM5T1Q,True,So nice I bought it twice,"I originally bought the penlight for work and lost it on vacation. I tried a different high quality penlight with it's pros (lower lumens on low setting, strobe light option for emergencies) and cons (blue hue light, no pupil gauge).

After using it for about a month I went back to this light buying it again. The only con this penlight has is a relatively bright low setting. You need to be mindful as a clinician not to point the light directly into patients eyes, and to not point it closely.

The pros however are phenomenal. Better visibility and color of skin and wounds. Pupil gauge on the side. I even realized how much I appreciate the subtle grip texture.

This is a solid 9/10 penlight for medical staff, and would be a 10/10 if the lowest lumens were just a bit lower.",the united states,"June 27, 2019",David G.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:55:56.391092,2020-11-12 14:55:56.638907,"Nitecore MT06MD 180 Lumen Nichia LED Medical Penlight Flashlight For Doctors, Nurses and EMTs with 2x AAA Batteries & Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer (Black w/Pupil Gauge)",4.3,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B074X8YXT7,,"#524,911 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

5,R1TLSCKHXNMWBE,True,Nice but not perfect...,"This is a nice light. Color differentiation is excellent. Always coming on in low mode should have made it handy for medical professionals who might use it for eye exams. However, it did sometimes flash briefly in high as I turned it on, so maybe not. The medium and high modes make the penlight versatile enough for general purposes. However, the body of the penlight is pretty slippery. I get that it looks classy or professional but some texturing would have made it more useful for general purposes. The button on mine felt a little loose and it's possible that the incidental high flash upon activation was due to defect. I'm not sure. I ended up returning it.",the united states,"June 23, 2018",Metabble,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:55:56.646898,2020-11-12 14:55:56.923778,"Nitecore MT06MD 180 Lumen Nichia LED Medical Penlight Flashlight For Doctors, Nurses and EMTs with 2x AAA Batteries & Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer (Black w/Pupil Gauge)",4.3,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B074X8YXT7,,"#524,911 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

6,RDF1C2YQPWE41,True,Really big letdown,"UPDATE 12/11/18:
I've pretty much stopped using this light because of a few issues. The biggest issue is the clip is the flimsiest pocket clip I've ever used; it bends very easily and becomes essentially useless, leaving me with a penlight that can't even be placed in a pen pocket without having it fall out. I can't count the number of times I had to take the cap off and bend the clip back into place.
I wish the tail-switch was more receded into the body of the light, or at least require a deeper/harder press to activate it; I've gone on scene of a call, only to find out that the light inadvertantly turned on some time throughout the day and drained the battery, forcing me to use the disposable lights. All in all, I really tried to like this light, but I do not trust it enough to carry it on me without a backup light.

If you're tired of using those disposable lights and are looking at getting a nicer penlight, then I highly recommend this one. You really can't beat the price.
The LED throws out a cool white light that doesn't wash out colors. If you're in the medical field, you'll know how important that is; your patient won't appear to be pale as some other lights may lead you to believe.
On the minimum setting, it CAN be a little too bright to shine directly into patient's eyes while indoors, but that can be resolved with a little repositioning of the light.
I do wish the clicky button would've been rubberized or felt more sturdy, because as it is, I feel like that would be the first thing to break.
Overall, highly recommend this product to any person (medical provider or not) who is looking for a compact, yet relatively bright, penlight.",the united states,"September 4, 2017",Christian,2.0,0,2020-11-12 14:55:56.931767,2020-11-12 14:55:57.173852,"Nitecore MT06MD 180 Lumen Nichia LED Medical Penlight Flashlight For Doctors, Nurses and EMTs with 2x AAA Batteries & Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer (Black w/Pupil Gauge)",4.3,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B074X8YXT7,,"#524,911 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

7,RIO93XBDH1GGO,True,Unbelievable difference from other LED flashlights when using for medical assessments,"Use it daily in the ER. Compared it to the flashlight I previously had been using and there was a HUGE difference. Light color was immediately apparent when looking at patients throat when comparing one to the other. This one had more natural light and the other with usual LED distorted the color. I really like the 4 lumen instant light for pupils or even throat visualization and can go up to about 200 lumens with a couple more clicks if needed.

8,R2YAMB6A45QYZC,True,A failed EDC light and a disappointed EMT.,"I bought this penlight to serve as an EDC inspection light while working as an EMT. I’ve been carrying it over 80 hours/week for 3 months. The light is turned on by a tail switch and you cycle through the modes either by pressing the tail switch in rapid succession or rotating the bezel. Almost every time I go to use the light the bezel has been slightly turned in my pocket so I have to press the tail switch and then fiddle with the bezel to get the light to come on. Incredibly unreliable and it makes me look unprofessional. The pocket clip has poor retention so it often slides out of my pen pocket.

28,R1LOKAEZQ49KML,True,"Nearly perfect, but please make a stronger clip!!","I love this flashlight. I’ve used it nearly everyday for about six months on duty as a paramedic. Low light is perfect for pupils and most quick tasks. And the med and bright settings work great for a wide range of things.

Only one thing that really bothers me is the clip. It’s made from really flimsy metal and constantly gets bent out of shape. I keep this under the flap in my first pocket 90% of the time so I’m not too worried generally. But even just living in my shirt pocket the clip gets bent out and very loose. The other 10% of the time it sits clipped in the corner of my duty pants and that’s when I worry it’ll fall out. To bend it back it’s easy enough, just unscrew the top, take it off and bend it. But it really isn’t that strong and to have such a great light marred by something so small really is a shame.
