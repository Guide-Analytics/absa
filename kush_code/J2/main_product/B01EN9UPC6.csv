0,R2I0KDZEPH29VP,True,Be warned... It does not include the battery... Good luck finding one.,"I am very unhappy with my purchase. This is a high quality, expensive flashlight which I really needed for work. Unfortunately it does not come with the rechargeable battery. It is my fault for not reading all the details carefully but it is not really clear that you have to order the battery separately. Also to make matters worse I cannot order the battery by itself... Only as a package at another large cost. Really disappointed with this company. I do not recommended buying from them, although the flashlight is of high quality I am angry that their advertising is misleading.

1,R2QST3ZOZBZJDP,True,Amazing light but you need to remove plastic on the top of button top18650 for a proper connection,It is an absolutely amazing light. It's super compact and great for many applications. It's useful from anything from hunting and emergencies to protection. The strobe mode is almost too brite and the throw distance is exactly as described. One side note is that not all 18650 batteries will work. The ones with the button top have plastic surrounding the button. If you remove the plastic on the top of the battery it will operate fine.

7,R33HKCWHT7PQ29,False,The last flashlight you’ll ever need,"UPDATED UPDATE: Oct 15/2020
Passed 4 years of ownership now, still working flawlessly. I have purchased a newer battery, not because the old one didn’t work anymore but it’s older now/seen many charge cycles and I didn’t want to risk having it die on me in a serious situation. The new battery is also from Nitecore and labeled “NL1835HP” it provides an extra 100mAh of juice compared to my original “NL189” and I would recommend it if you were to purchase this flashlight since it doesn’t come with one.

UPDATE: Dec 12/2019
I have owned this torch for over 3 years now and it continues to impress. Being dropped onto rocks, into water, covered in mud, cold temperatures. Button works like new. I’m still using the same battery and it doesn’t seem like it’s lost a significant amount of power or life and I use it often (**Battery was bought separately!**) It’s been on many more excursions with me, I just throw it in my bag and know I can rely on it. It’s proven itself so much I’ve decided to buy another one as a gift.

Original review:
I have owned this torch for over a year now and it has done extremely well and far exceeded my expectations. I’ve used it in multiple countries from hunting to caving, in rain and snow. I find the lowest mode very handy for searching for something in a tent or going to the bathroom without a blinding amount of light that could wake others. The beam concentration is fantastic, allowing the throw to be very far yet enough flood lighting for up close use (It always surprises everybody that a flashlight with its size can throw so far). As for the battery life, personally I think it lasts long for the performance it provides if you’re mindful and don’t leave it on turbo when you don’t actually need to (with the 3400mah 18650 battery which is usually purchased separately, they are somewhat expensive but I’m still using the same one since the start so I’m happy with it). The versatility of being able to recharge it without removing the battery or needing an external charger has made it that much more portable and convenient. The ability to check it’s remaining power with the button light is a genius feature as well. I bring it everywhere with me and I’m not being paid or compensated for a review, I genuinely love this flashlight and would recommend anybody to get it.",canada,"November 4, 2018",Raymond M.,5.0,4,2020-11-12 14:20:31.530572,2020-11-12 14:20:31.677888,"Nitecore MH20GT CREE XP-L HI V3 USB Rechargeable EDC Flashlight, 414 yd, 1000 lm",4.0,119.97,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01EN9UPC6,,"#203,430 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

Cuando la batería está baja se deshabilita la máxima potencia para ahorrar energía. Recomiendo usar baterías de buena marca para sacarle provecho, ya que de las más baratas no sé si tengan la capacidad de descarga suficiente a máxima potencia.

11,RDVU062EBWDX6,True,"Great specs and performance, small ding for quirks in the opperation","I did alot of research before getting this light. This is my EDC (everyday carry) light that I keep clipped inside my front pants pocket. I replaced (sometimes switch back and forth) this light from and a Fenix PD32ue. The Fenix has a wider beam with around the same lumen output. I wanted something with more throw this time around.
Pros:The intensity and throw is unmatched by any thing else with the same package size. The recharging port is great, as I don't want to keep swapping out half used batteries and I'm always worried when the batter might run out. I just top off the charge after moderate use and I'm good to go. The clip holds the light deeper in my pocket than my other lights, so I'm not getting stabbed in the side when i'm bending over (but this is a personal choice of where I choose to carry my light) The instant on to min or max is great feature and I previously had to cover the front of the light when I wanted the low setting after turning the light on with my other lights.

Cons:
Coming from all my other lights with a tactical tail cap button, it takes me a little while longer to find the button and turn on the Nitecore. The on/off gets confused if you use it too fast. The light will go to high, low back to high and won't turn offf if you click the single button too fast. I've had it stay on minimum for a whole day in my pocket when it should have been off.

If it wasn't for the occasional hiccup with the on/off, this would be the perfect light for me. I'd also want the main on/off on the tail cap, for faster deployment.

***UPDATE ***
So today (about 15 months later) the switch on the light has gone off to lunch and has yet to return. The only low point that I dinged this light for has now failed. The light now does random actions with the single ""dual purpose"" switch. Sometimes it turns on, sometimes it switches modes, sometimes it doesn't turn on at all. Switching modes will turn the light off. Sometimes the light wont even turn off, and I have to unscrew the tail cap to turn it off. I've contacted Nitecore about warranty support and I will continue to update this review as to how their customer service goes. I've requested an RMA for repair or replacement of my light.
