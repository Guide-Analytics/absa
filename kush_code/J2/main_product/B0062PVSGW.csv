8,R7HJT0EXUYR0G,True,Seit 4 Jahren ein treuer Begleiter.,"Ich kann hier eine echte Langzeitrezension abgeben. Ich habe diese Lampe 2013 hier bei Amazon erworben. Seit dem funktioniert sie tadellos, hat auch schon einige harte Einsätze hinter sich, ist mehrfach gefallen und hat zig Batterien verbraucht, das einzige Manko, denn die benötigten CR123 sind nicht unbedingt billig. Ich benutze ausnahmslos die Duracell Ultra, nachdem ich verschiedene andere Marken getestet habe. Ich bin im Sicherheitsgewerbe tätig und nutze diese Lampe auch als Backup zur dienstlich gelieferten Maglite. Gegen die Fenix sind diese nämlich echte Funzeln. Ein kleiner Nachteil, bei voller Leuchtstärke über längere Zeit wird die Lampe warm bis heiß. Das hat sich aber zu keiner Zeit negativ ausgewirkt. Die Hitze wird sehr gut abgeleitet. Das Verhältnis Größe zur Leistung ist hier echt gut gelungen. Das Ding paßt auch ohne die mitgelieferte Holstertasche überall rein. Mitlerweile hat man im Betrieb auf LED Lenser P14 umgestellt. Von denen sind aber schon ein paar ausgefallen. Ich kann die Fenix nur wämrstens empfehlen. Allerdings gilt das für das von mir erworbene Modell, in 5 Jahren sind bestimmt einige Änderungen vorgenommen worden, so das sich meine Rezension nicht unbedingt auf die neuen Modelle umlegen läßt.",germany,"February 27, 2018",Matthias,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:29:16.343549,2020-11-12 11:29:16.468215,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

9,R1DL0P3E5HQW3X,True,Die perfekte Taschenlampe,"Hatte vorher die Fenix LD 20, welche auch schon ganz nett war. Mich störte, dass die Lampe keinen zweiten Schalter für die Lichtstufenregulierung hatte und man den Lampenkopf drehen musste um in den Powermodus zu gelangen. Wenn man nicht aufpasst, lockert sich dieser mit der Zeit immer mehr und ich bezweifle, dass sie dann noch wasserdicht ist. Wollte eigentlich auf die LD 22 (58 €) umsteigen, die kostet aber hier bei Amazon mehr als die PD 32 (56 €). Nun habe ich für weniger Geld eine bessere Lampe erwischt, prima ;). Die Taschenlampe wird hier von der Firma SMDV wirklich zu einem sehr günstigen Preis angeboten, die Lieferung ging flott und die Ware war sicher verpackt.

Die PD 32 liegt viel besser in der Hand als die LD 20, da sie minimal dicker, aber dafür kürzer ist. Die LD 20 erinnert mehr an einen Stift, als an eine Taschenlampe und man hat angst, dass sie einem aus der Hand fallen könnte. Auch optisch sieht die PD 32 besser aus, als die LD 20. Der zweite Schalter am Lampenkopf der PD 32 funtioniert sehr gut und lässt sich auch noch mit normalen Flieshandschuhen ertasten. Wegen der Kürze der Lampe, liegt der Daumen schon auf richtiger Höhe um den Wechselschalter zu bedienen. Was die Helligkeit angeht, ist ein großer Unterschied zur LD 20 erkennbar. Subjektiv gesehen, doppelte Reichweite.
Ich nutze die Lampe um mit meinem Hund (ohne Leine) auch noch im dunkeln auf dem Feldweg spazieren zu gehen. Die Lampe hat 4 Helligkeitsstufen, wovon mir Stufe 2 ausreicht um meinen Hund zu beobachten ( bis ca, 30 mtr.). Ich finde das Lichtfeld perfekt, man hat einen schönen Punktstrahl und einen gut gewählten Lichtkranz drumherum, d. h. der Hund kann rumflitzen wie er will, ich verliere ihn nie aus den Augen. Ist mir viel lieber und praktischer als eine fokusierbare Lampe, an der ich ständig drehen oder schieben muss und evtl. eine zweite Hand brauche. Zudem reicht die PD 32 ca. 150 mtr. weit, das reicht auf jeden Fall. Die Lampe hat bessere Laufzeiten als die LD 20, allerdings braucht man halt die CR 123A Batterien oder Akkus. Da ich die Lampe kaum ausreize (meist nur zum Spaß) und überwiegend auf Stufe 2 betreibe, ergibt sich eine Laufzeit von ca. 16 Std., weshalb ich es erst einmal mit Ersatzbatterien versuche. Ich brauche die Lampe eigentlich nur während der Winterzeit, kann sein, dass mir 1 oder 2 Bateriewechsel pro Jahr ausreicht. Insofern würden sich Akkus+Ladegerät wohl kaum für mich lohnen.
Übrigens lässt sie die PD 32 im Gegensatz zur LD 20 auch mit Gürtelclip in der Gürteltasche verstauen.

Wer eine entsprechend kleine, aber Leistungssarke Tachenlampe sucht ist mit der PD 32 bestens bedient und sollte sie der LD 20/22 auf jeden Fall vorziehen, es sei denn, die Taschenlampe muss unbedingt mit billigen AAA-Batterien betrieben werden.",germany,"January 2, 2013",F.

点灯具合が悪くなったので購入先に問い合わせしたところ、接触面のメンテ等を勧められる。

30,R2G1SBAPCWAOZ,True,バランス最高,"・アウトドア使用目的で購入いたしました。
・コンバーター内蔵で、バッテリーが切れるまで同じ明るさを維持します。
・18650使用で、同じ明るさを維持してくれるライトは数が限られると思います。
・正確なランタイムは判りかねますが、プロトタイプでランタイム計測していたサイトがありましたので載せておきます。
[...]

・バッテリーは長さ70mmの18650でも問題なく使えました。
・（＋）側電極ですが、LED側電極が飛び出ているので、フラットトップの18650でも使用可能と思われます。（未経験）

・使用終盤には減光していきますが、ターボが利かなくなる⇒ハイが利かなくなるといった感覚で、ハイが利かなくなった時点でのバッテリーの開放電圧は2.77ボルトでした。（消灯迄は試していません）

・太さはマグライト2AAの太い部分とほぼ同じ（若干細い程度）、長さがコンパクトです。マグライトNi-H電池込みで126g程度ですから、18650バッテリー込みで108gはとても軽く感じます。（マグライトLEDより小さくてこの明るさ・ランタイムは、以前のライトへ戻ろうとは思いません。）

・注意点としてはPD30等の対応ディフューザーと関連付けられていますが、こちらの商品には取り付けられません。PD31・PD32専用のディフューザーでないと径が合いません。（4月6日現在、残念ながらアマゾンでの販売はしていないようです。）
・ディフューザーは精度もよく、しっかりと取り付けられ、マジックのキャップを取り外すようにキュポッと抜けます。本当に蛍光灯のように発光してくれます。

・サイドスイッチが壊れ易そうな印象を受けます。（たまに誤動作：押しても作用しない等があり、不安があります）

・耐久性に不安を残しますが、現時点では僕の使用環境での最高のライトとなります。
・メモリー効果の少ない充電式バッテリーで、電圧の管理をしてくれる充電器（或いは充電池の2重保護）で、18650初心者でも比較的安全に使用できるのではないでしょうか？（減光したら使用しないと決めておけば）僕はキャンプ好きなバイク仲間に勧めます。",japan,"April 6, 2012",harurinko,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:29:30.814364,2020-11-12 11:29:30.958205,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

33,RGEVJ99AWYI23,True,"Best light ever! Affordable, but extremely high quality and BRIGHT!","My favorite flashlight! I use this for work, (which is how I justify the price, low though it is compared to other similar products,) and immediately bought a new one after losing my first. All told, I've had this flashlight for 6 years, (with the one repurchase in the middle of that time,) and never had any problem with it. It's incredibly bright and compact, frequently impressing my coworkers who spent much more on much fancier, and usually bulkier, lights. It lacks a zoom, but I don't miss it. This beam can illuminate the corner of a dark room over a hundred feet away, while still being broad enough for close quarters. There is a strobe feature which I occasionally stumble across, but can never remember how to trigger it. I'm sure if I used it regularly it'd be easy enough. The included lanyard is very handy for hanging overhead, as a safety on my wrist when working at height, or for easily fishing out of a tool pouch or pocket. The belt clip is a little tight, but works great when needed. My only real criticism of the light is the weird little side button which toggles through 3 or 4 brightness levels. It can be fiddly to find by touch alone, and not easy even when you're looking at the darn thing, and I always forget which brightness level it is currently on and how many levels there are, so I always have to cycle through the levels 2 full times to zero in on what I want. A 4-step sliding switch or something would be much more intuitive. Still works great though. Also, the batteries are best purchased in bulk for the cheapest price, and then you'll never run out.

34,R1BVEANUOCPUAF,True,Fenix PD32 flashlight; very well-made and very bright,"I bought this to use as my EDC flashlight. I'd n ever owned a Fenix product before but decided on this one due to a review on a youtube channel I trust. Boy was I surprised.

In the youtube review, the reviewer showed the brightness levels as well as the S.O.S. and beacon modes. But you can tell how bright a flashlight is in a video only so much. This thing is much brighter than I thought it would be.

When my cat has to go out at night and I have to go out and look for her (she likes to explore sometimes), I always a flashlight with me so I can point it in places I need to see. The first night I had this was one of those nights. I was amazed at how much better I could see with this light than with my old flashlight (don't know the model of that light). This flashlight will light up both of the huge oak trees in our front yard with little problem It will even shine across the road into my neighbors tree (about 50-60 feet) and allow me to see very well into that tree.....and that's not even on the turbo setting. I like the tail cap switch and the setting button on the side. It makes it easier than having to push the power switch several times or at different intervals or holding it down to switch between the different settings.

The pocket clip is very well-made and is neither too tight nor too loose. I don't carry it in my pocket, though, rather in a sheath on my EDC bag.

I would definitely recommend this flashlight to anyone looking for a great EDC light that is lightweight but also carries a lot of functionality.",the united states,"March 7, 2015",sk33tr,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:29:31.356917,2020-11-12 11:29:31.497602,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

It is small and light, fits easily into my pocket or clips on the outside so I can take it with me when I go out at night, when I go hiking, when I go to the movies, etc. It is versatile, so I can have it on the lowest power setting, but can also ramp it up to flood the whole area with bright light. This Summer I was in New Mexico taking a short hike after sunset and came across a bear and her cubs on the trail. The bright light helped me see them clearly from a distance, and also encouraged them to go the other way. When I'm walking around my neighborhood for exercise after dark, when cars come, I turn it on so they can easily see me. It has far surpassed my expectations.

36,R3B335N0TYYVNH,True,Not an L4 but Good for the Money,"This is my first Fenix Flashlight. Prior to buying the PD32 I ran a Surefire L4 LumaMax. It was a great flashlight and worked flawlessly for 9 years. As an avid outdoors men and elk hunting guide, I used the L4 hard...really hard! Mine was stepped on by a horse, dropped off a 50' cliff, dropped out of a tree stand (4 times) and bounced around in the bed of my pickup for two straight weeks. Not to mention many other acts of cruel and unusual punishment. But recently the LED head finally burned out so I contacted Surefire to check about a replacement head. However, I received no response from customer service. Made contact a second time, but again no response. So I decided to try another brand and after much research settled on the Fenix PD32.

This is a bright flashlight, but in my opinion it is not as bright as my old L4, which was rated at only 160 lumens compared to 315 for the PD32. I also believe the overall construction of my L4 was heaver and it just feels more solidly made than the PD32. Still a new L4, which has been discontinued, would costs about $190 compared to $50 or so for the PD32. So for the price I think the PD32 will be hard to beat. While the PD32 is not as bright as my old L4, it is still adequately bright. I do like the different power setting options and the bet clip seems solid. On the other, the very flimsy belt holster is be pretty much worthless for the kind of usage this light will experience. No worries, though, because the PD32 fits into my Surefire holster, which is very thick and heavy duty.

So I think the real test will come at the point of durability. Only time will tell how well the PD32 will holds up after being buried in snow for 3 weeks and covered with animal blood more times then I can remember...among other things.",the united states,"November 28, 2015",TreeBark,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:29:31.633657,2020-11-12 11:29:31.758840,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

37,RID7CYXSLRVO9,True,Great portable flashlight,"I have purchased this item for self-defense and general tool purposes, and it is excellent in both fields. The general amount of lumens I was recommended for self defense, was to have at least 150 lumens. I wanted to go for overkill and I am not disappointed at all. I had someone use it on me at an arm’s length away at night, and not only did I blink I physically recoiled from unexpected amount of light. At farther distance away with the street lamp light behind the person I could not make out any silhouette, and could only make out the bright light. And strobe wasn’t really necessary for me to be disoriented and blinded, but strobe added to the effect. And the size is perfect for my pocket and makes carrying the flashlight very easy. I have carried it with me daily since getting the item.
Now for the minor cons. The mode is switch by how you press the side switch, however the side switch is very hard to locate if hurried. The side switch is in this rubberish material that blends in with the rest of the flashlight if you are trying to feel it out. So I would probably never get to the strobe mode if I had to use it for self defense. Which once again should be fine since the brightest mode is more than enough for my needs.
Which reminds me, there are four brightness modes. Lowest which is almost uselessly low but may work if you wake in the middle of the night, lower and higher middle settings are so close in brightness to one another that they may as well be one, then the brightest setting which is wonderfully bright and can light a whole room to a visible level. Then there is the strobe mode and SOS, but strobe takes about 3 seconds to turn on, which makes it useless for self defense. SOS turns on if you keep holding, but it took me few tries to figure that one out.
It’s a wonderful flashlight overall and I have already dropped it twice while it was on and the flashlight isn’t damaged one bit.

38,R2GBRV24VY4WHB,True,Another incredible Fenix product!!,"Bought one for myself and one for my Brother-in law for Christmas.

Amazing!! It may be a nearly perfect compact high power 2 battery torch, especially given the price point. Shape, size, functionality, all top notch. I wouldn't change a thing. Soft touch on the rear button, temporary on, full click, constant on. Four power modes switched by a button on the forward side of the unit behind the bezel. Hold for two seconds and get the strobe function. Strictly from a tactical standpoint for law enforcement or military, it would definitely make more sense to have the power level control button on the rear of the unit as a function of the main switch button, so you can change settings while holding it in the traditional manner with your thumb, while holding a handgun in the other hand. However, since I don't intend to use it this way, I like it the way it is. Most folks will use it grasping it in their palm with their thumb right where the power output level switch is located. With a small bit of practice, one could certainly operate it with the reverse tactical grip, thumb to the rear, and change power levels with your pinky finger.

Extremely powerful on full high Turbo mode. I know all the companies tend to exaggerate lumen levels, so I have no idea if 315 is correct, but I can say it is damn impressive!! Look at it head on and it is not only blinding, it is actually physically painful. It rarely needs to be used in turbo mode, and it shouldn't be to preserve battery life, and bulb life for that matter. Inside an enclosed area, it's actually too much light. Distracting really.

I have a PD 20 for daily carry which I absolutely adore. Very small single battery unit, VERY powerful as well. Clip it inside my right pants pocket and barely notice it. Use it every day for home renovation work. 180 lumen claim. No reason to doubt it. The PD 32 is definitely significantly brighter, but obviously twice as large length wise and would need to clip on my belt or in the holster it comes with. The PD 20 is just too small and convenient to switch over to the new one for carrying everyday. The 32 still goes with me in the car or in the toolbox, and I still love it, but if I have to choose one to have on my person, it's the PD 20 for it's size. Also may be a bit redundant, but I have an E05 on my keychain as well!! Very nice little AAA light. Don't need it too often because I usually have the other one on me, but it's handy now and then when I don't.

In summary, I have nothing but positive things to say about Fenix in general. I love all the lights I have from them. Quality is first rate. I must admit, it does bother the patriotic side of me that they are made in China vs. the USA, but for the quality and the price point, I don't think you can find a better light. If Surefire had a bit more tolerable price tag, I'd probably have some of their products, but they are just too damn expensive. Well, I do buy their batteries.

39,R1JXWTTQ8Y6ULR,True,I would love to say I love it but the range button ....no i do love it!,"This has become my new bedside torch.

It is small and compact and has run well on one battery charge for some time.

It has a good range of brightness with the lower settings being good for in the house at night and the brighter settings great for outside at night.

My only issue with this and it's not a big deal but, the torch will turn back on at whatever level setting you turn it off at, which is mostly fine unless it was turned off in the brightest setting and then you go to turn it on again later and it blinds you (or at least stifles your vision because you have just turned it on after waking in the pitch black) and you go to adjust it and the toggle button is not prominent enough to do this quickly.

Still a great torch, brilliant brightness for the size and money, but this small issue bugs me sometimes. If there was a slightly flattened surface where the button is or the button was easier to distinguish at night. I would give it five stars.

It is still going on the first charge and I am used to the toggle button. great little powerful light! 5 stars !

40,RET6GSYKW01H5,True,Excellent EDC every day carry tool,"Have been looking forward to this Fenix light, and was not been let down upon receipt. The turbo brightness is amazing compared to my older Mini Maglite, which I recently read tops out at around 70 lumens. This compact beast outshines and outperforms it in other ways besides that. The mass is less (99 grams vs. 132), it's shorter by 1.5"", and has a convenient clip if one so desires. It also has the hex barrel to limit rolling. The PD32's body is well-made, waterproof to 2m, and has a scratch-resistant face. The light comes with an extra tailcap tip and a pair of extra O-rings for the body. The one thing the Maglite has that this lacks is a flat tailcap profile suitable for standing on end. I have no other concerns. Other observations (all at night):

The PD32's corona, at its outer edge, is brighter than the hot spot of the minimag.
The PD32, aimed at a white 17' ceiling, can light a medium-size room well beyond minimum reading level
The PD32 clearly illuminates objects 170 feet away. I haven't tested distance visibility but it's going to be substantial.
Nighttime navigation on a trail is easy, and in fact turbo is probably too high. The corona is wide enough that bobbing from holding it doesn't leave the next footstep in the dark.

Minor wish list: focusing ability, even lower 'low' setting, adapter for standing it upright.

Overall very few issues. It's light, efficient and very bright. For around-the-house use it's excellent, and outdoors it does well also.

41,R1J1V0EQO4NQNC,True,Superb light for general or tactical use,"There are many reasons to love this light. I ordered it based on the ability to utilize different batteries as well as the positive review history.

Pros:
- VERY bright in the strongest mode.
- variable power settings allow for use in nearly any situation without burning through battery power.
- ability to use CR123 lithium or 18650 lithium rechargeable batteries. Light is designed to use the 18650 thus making good rechargeable batteries a solid option. This alone makes it very worthwhile.
- the brightest mode is exceedingly useful for a tactical light. It will dazzle your opponent and the some.
- fits in the palm of your hand, lightweight and simple to use.
- controls are easy, tailcap switch press for momentary on and click for constant on.
- intensity button on the bezel makes it easy to switch between intensity settings.
- lowest setting is very useful for basic needs without eating the battery while still providing sufficient light for performing tasks.
- great run time even with the 18650 rechargeable. I strongly recommend the following battery:

Cons:
- for tactical use, the light is small and not particularly good for anything but producing light. It's definitely not a D-cell mag light if you know what I mean.

Overall I am exceedingly pleased. Small size for everyday use and carry, flexibility on light output and battery usage and excellent price for what you get! It's very hard to do better!

42,R2N54HPBTYLXQV,True,Tac Light for AR-15,"This will be the fourth light I had on the rifle, but so far the best. It is extremely bright, and the tail-cap button is easily manipulated with the back of the finger (it is set in an Elzetta mount, just forward of the foregrip). What sold me on this light is that there are two switches. The tail cap button just turns it on or off; half-press for momentary or click to leave it on. The second switch, on the side of the bezel, sets your mode- low power, medium, high, ""turbo"", and strobe. And it stays where you set it until you change it. This is far preferable to a cheaper light I mistakenly purchased that had a single switch that required you to cycle through all modes each time you clicked the switch.

The PD32 uses C123A batteries, which for me is not an issue. I used several lights with these batteries, and while they are a little more espensive than AA's, the lights are brighter and more reliable.

As to durablility, the jury is still out at that. After I've used this for a while, I'll update my review. But for now, I'm quite happy with the purchase.

(A note to purchasers- After removing the PD32 and installing the batteries, I was dismayed to find that the light did not work. I was ready to send a nasty email to Fenix when I thought perhaps I should check the unit a little more closely. It turns out the head of the light was loose; I screwed it down tight, the light came on, and I was blind for a couple of minutes.

43,R1JBNL83R4WL2V,True,Great price for a GREAT tactical light!,"I've always been a fan of tactical (aka ridiculously bright) flashlights, but, since it is something I don't particular ""have"" to have, but rather just something I have wanted, as a cool and practical tool to have handy (dim flashlights are seriously annoying) I have not felt that it's something I want to spend several hundred dollars to buy. So, I was very pleased to see this nifty fella for a very decent price.

I read outside reviews from folks who actually use and and rely on various high power ""tactical"" flashlights, and, thanks to the experts, I settled on this brand. What sold me on this particular model (an upgrade from the highly praised PD30) was the addition of a rubberized side button for easily operating the brightness settings (and activating or deactivating the strobe and SOS modes). This seemed a much better idea than other models, which have only the single back button and a bunch of complex quarter, half, and whole pushes to access functions.

Other awesome features -- it ""remembers"" which setting you last used, so no need to scroll through settings repeatedly, just set it where you want it, with the side button, and the back button will go right to where you left it; there are four settings for battery power savings (and the third lowest setting is PLENTY bright, and will leave a person seeing spots to look at it); you can press the back button partially for just flashing the light (""signal"" use); it has (as mentioned) a strobe function, plus automatic SOS function; it's impact resistant, water proof, has a SOLID build quality, comes with a very cool carrying case, a lanyard, and extra sealing rings, and of course, the huge perk is the fact that if you WANT it to be insanely bright, the ""turbo"" mode, as they call it, is indeed blinding, at 315 super white lumens. This is truly an ""all in one"" kind of flashlight.

All of this, for far FAR less than any tactical light I have ever considered buying. Yes, it costs probably more than twice the ""super bright"" flashlights that hardware stores sell, in the 20 to 25 dollar range, but this is easily a zillion times brighter than any regular store bought light. I mean, for example, I spent 35 bucks, last year, on a supposed ""10 lumen"" flashlight -- a nice unit actually -- but this baby, even at the second to lowest setting, dwarfs it, by far.

So, it's worth every penny, for what I was looking for, and, in fact, is far more than I ever hoped to get, at a price that is far less than even one hundred dollars.

44,R10WTNBC4LNB7U,True,It's Worth Twice This Much,"LED flashlights are a dime a dozen nowadays. Why care about this one? Pull up a chair. I'll tell you:

Simply: It's as nice (or nicer) than a very high end model and it costs not considerably more than a low-end model.

On low power, the light lasts effectively forever. More than a solid week of day and night. And it's as much light as you need indoors. On high power, it's very bright for its compact size. I can't imagine a reason for your average civilian to even need that much light. So output is fantastic. The ability to vary the output also is. There is a good range of output/power conservation between the highest and the lowest. Not so many that it's cumbersome to use, and not so few that it's hard to find the right one.

Build quality also is great. It's rugged, tough, extremely water resistant, the clip works great, the feel of the buttons is perfect, the size is ideal... It's everything I wanted.

For some people the batteries will be an issue so let me address that: At least for me, the CR2 batteries are a feature. I don't personally need to have a flashlight continuously on for a full week of the year. So that I need batteries that have multi-year lifespans. Also, I need it to work well in sub-zero temperatures. And it does. With AAs, neither would be the case. Since it drains power so incredibly slowly for my use case, the cost of a slightly more expensive battery is negligible. Do the math for yourself.

I have one very small gripe: The button which changes the brightness is difficult to find in the dark (which is when you use a flashlight). With my large hands I have to fumble around for several seconds rotating the light and probing with my thumb. Not ideal, but not enough to drop a star.",the united states,"April 17, 2014",Charles Harwood,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:29:35.828841,2020-11-12 11:29:35.959509,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

45,R1EV0X4598GEHW,True,"Very bright, very sturdy, great price","There is a newer version of this, an Ultra version, that is supposed to have more than double the output for about twice the price, but I was loathe to spend $100-plus. I found this to be a very capable light, with all the features of it's more expensive cousins, and at a much more reasonable price.

Consider purchasing a rechargeable, single cell (like the Fenix ARB-L2) battery with this item (or in a package with one), or perhaps think about purchasing a couple of the LiFePO4 with a charger, it will cut down on battery overhead. Always keep a few of the non-rechargeables around (they last for years), but in non-emergent situations, use the rechargeables.

I love the strobing feature and I'm impressed with the inclusion of the SOS pattern; this might turn out to (literally) be a life saver!

46,R15SEMTGPR3E58,True,This thing is AWESOME!! :-),"I gotta tell ya that this is quickly becoming one of my favorite flashlights. This thing puts out some SERIOUS, pure white light yet it has a push switch near the head where the brightness can be dialed down, to conserve battery life. It turns on and off with a push switch at the rear - where you also access the batteries. For its size, this is a very well-made and powerful flashlight made of heavy-duty machined aluminum and it comes with a very stiff black pocket clip. The on/off push switch can be lightly pressed to instantly turn the light on and off (by releasing it) without the need to click the switch all the way down for full-time on. I would think that this would work well in a tactical situation where you only want the light on momentarily, perhaps to blind an attacker. At full power, this is a blindingly bright, white light with a very good light pattern. The light cannot be focused but there is a very bright, full circle of light in the very center and a fairly wide halo of ambient light from that center point which provides more than enough light for a wide area around that center point. Overall, this is a great weather-tight, bright, tough light that can be used as an everyday light (with the lumens lowered) or as a tactical light (to perhaps blind an attacker) with lumens pumped up.

47,RIHO7KG2A0MI,True,"My first super extreme flashlight, no, TORCH","Like whoa. This thing is bright. I just turned off the living room lights and completely and utterly blinded my wife with it - just to see what would happen if I walked downstairs in the middle of the night after hearing a weird noise and found a thief in our house. To be fair, I let her do it to me afterward, and from my own personal experience now I can tell you that this light is bewilderingly bright. It actually causes confusion when aimed in your face. I can't tell if I actually felt heat from it all the way across the room or if my brain was just so utterly boggled at the brightness that it reacted by telling my body I was too close to the sun. Either way, that's how bright this thing is.

I bought this as a general purpose emergency preparedness light - power failures, being lost in the woods at night, and for home security.

Well, that was a loss of $170 that I don't want to tempt a second time, so I end up getting this unit.

While I prefer the look and feel of the Surefire, this little Fenix is really amazing. Variable output as well as the ""blind"" mode compared to just low and high? This unit is amazing for the price.

I prefer the focus of the spot on the LX2 Surefire better, but they both throw a similar beam. I think past 50 yards, the Surefire has slightly better and brighter throw for less lumen output, but for the price, quality and brightness of this torch, you really can't go wrong.

First off, I love this flashlight. I've been through many flashlights in the past yet this one is by far one of my favorites. It has four(4) intensity levels that can selected through a side dimmer button:

9 Lumens = 200hrs Low Intensity
70 Lumens = 16hrs Mid Intensity
130 Lumens = 8hrs High Intensity
315 Lumens = 2 hrs Turbo

It uses two(2) CR123A batteries or one(1) 18650 Li-ion Battery

It also has Strobe and a S.O.S. feature when you depress the side dimmer button. Hold the dimmer button for one second and it activates strobe mode. Hold the dimmer bottom for three seconds and it activates the S.O.S. mode. Also, the PD32 is waterproof up to 2meter/6feet

In the package it comes with the PD32 flashlight, holster, lanyard. body clip, spare o-ring and spare rubber switch boot. Comes in a little ziplock bag that's in the bottom of the holster. Just make sure to remove it before using the holster.

The only down side, as a personal preference, is that the button the on the tail end sticks out from the frame of the flashlight, so you're not able to use it as a candlelight such as Magnum flashlights.

58,R2606APERSUI9Q,True,Very Cool Tech!,"I've had this flashlight for about a month. I lowered my rating from 5 stars to 4 because it stopped working, and I had to fix it. It was not a big deal. The tail-cap button had unscrewed just a bit, and needed to be tightened. Fenix provides a spare boot for the tail switch, meaning customers are supposed to be able to deal with this tail switch themselves. However, I don't have the special tool used to screw in the switch. There are two small holes drilled into the aluminum ring, so I used my two-prong carving fork to screw it back in, but I don't think I got it tight enough. If Fenix provided the tool to screw this down tight, with some instructions on how to replace the switch boot, I'd give them 5 stars. I am also a bit concerned about the actual switch, which turns out to be made of plastic. That doesn't mean it's unreliable, but I'd feel better seeing an aircraft quality switch.

I think Fenix got this unit mostly right. I think I would prefer the PD-30's length, and integration of brightness control in the tail switch. I compare this to my son's Maglite XL-50. His flashlight is larger diameter and has a smaller LED, which combine to enable the XL-50 to have a central spot size of about 1/3 the area as the PD-32. The brightness of the center spots are about the same, though the Maglite XL-50 is only putting out 1/3 the lumens. They make bigger, more efficient LEDs (the Cree XM-L), but a bigger LED would cause the central bright spot to spread even more, making it dimmer. They could have put a bigger head on this flashlight, but I prefer the small diameter. The Cree XM-L can put out 1,000 lumens, but at 300, this tiny flashlight gets quite hot in about 10 minutes, so I don't think going brighter makes any sense. Overall, I think Fenix got the compromises just about right, with the exception of the separate tail and mode switches.

To provide a full 315 lumens, Fenix had to make several compromises. First, they sealed the LED (a Cree XP-G R5)into the head assembly. The down side is you can't use this flashlight in candle mode like my son's MagLite XL-50. My kids like that mode for making hand puppet shadows, and I've found it useful while camping in the past. However, it's best to seal away this LED, which gets dangerously hot at full power. I'm guessing they didn't want kids accidentally burning themselves or starting fires.

The head assembly has an anti-reflection super-clear glass lens, which is much nicer than the plastic lens on the MagLite. To get low brightness mode, the MagLite turns the light on and off rapidly (PWM), which is easy to see when moving objects rapidly through the beam. The Fenix provides constant lighting power at all brightness modes, and there's no frame-by-frame effect when objects move rapidly through the beam.

As for batteries, I bought two 18650 3000mAh Ultrafire rechargeable batteries. Do not buy these! They lie about the capacity by about 2X, and they discharge on their own in a couple of weeks.

75,R3KZDGW2WU5LHV,True,Sure choice over Surefire.,"High-output flashlights have been decreasing in price, and increasing in performance the past few years. My buddy had a Surefire and I was so envious, but could not justify the three-digit price. Once the Fenix PD32 went on sale, I had to pounce.

The brightness of the PD32 is astounding--in turbo mode, it can out-shine the low-beams of my car. Also, I lend it to my girlfriend when she walks our small dog at night. She feels an extra measure of safety with the big bad light that could warn an inattentive car driver of her presence, and spot a random coyote or skunk in the far distance. She loves it.

After reading the reviews for several different flashlights, the deal-breakers and winners came down to some core attributes: super-high lumen output, real world abuse, and price. I was impressed with the specs and price of the PD32, especially by one prototype tester/reviewer that clearly beat the crap out of it, and the PD32 still shined brightly. For me, the kicker was that it uses the lithium batteries with a 10-year shelf life.

Before spending significantly more dough than other flashlights, really take a look at how your going to use the product. If you're like most civilians such as me, there are much cheaper flashlights out there using standard alkaline batteries, such as the Nebo Redline and by Rayovac. (btw- those are NOT tactical flashlights. True tac lights can be mounted on firearms, like UTG and Streamlight.)

As I'm getting more involved with emergency and disaster response, I wanted a light that has serious capabilities plus have some measure of defense + offense that other units can't match. This flashlight absolutely fits the bill for my needs. I highly recommend this product.

p.s.- I'm considering the Fenix PD31 as a back-up, I really dig the 2 lumen low-output especially useful for camping and reading inside the tent. (btw- once in Yosemite, I heard a bear less than 15 yards away at night. It nearly freaked me out.

My only gripe is the body diameter and the forward button for selecting modes. As an EDC light, I wasn't expecting features from a combat light but the certainly would have been nice. It doesn't fit standard 1"" light mounts and you can't program it for push button strobe. You have to hold the forward button for a second to get the strobe function - after clicking it on.

80,R18ENSWMUGIDZ0,True,Ring in the beam and Hot ! CORRECTED !!,"The beam at 5.5 feet from a blank white wall has a 9 inch radius hotspot which is very bright and clear, however 18 inches from the edge of this hotspot is a 1 inch wide ring which I find quite irritating. There are quality issues with the LED head in the Fenix PD32 although the rest of the workmanship is acceptable. I am running this light on a 18650 battery.

I thought the ring was a PD31 problem but it seems this exists in PD32 as well.

Update: 18th July 2012: The flashlight becomes hot after barely 5 minutes of usage on max brightness. I can even feel the battery tube heating up. I have never noticed this on my TK15. Given the price differential its better to ditch the PD32 and go for a TK15.

UPDATE: 17th August 2012: I reported the beam problem to Fenix customer service in China and was asked to send in a photo of the beam with the ring. Within a few days I was told that they would be shipping me a replacement LED head assembly for the PD32 free of charge to India. This was shipped via china post and received by me within 2 weeks.

88,R3LEL7KW6CRJ3W,True,So Far So Good,"This flashlight is my first tactical flashlight. It is a leap past anything I have owned so far. This thing is bright, strong, and lightweight.

Brightness:
At 315 lumens I was skeptical that it would not be bright enough, but I was wrong. This flashlight has the ability to throw a beam and keep the brightness throughout the entire distance. All the modes to select from is just a bonus!

Strength:
This has been dropped a couple times and not even a scratch has appeared. My one year old son has chewed and drooled on it several times and it still works perfect. I use it mainly in the cold of Wisconsin winters and it performs beautifully.

Lightweight:
Ok, so this is my favorite part, and yes I do get excited over the little things. This flashlight, even WITH two CR123A batteries weights less than my iPhone! Just the phone too, I don't use a phone cover or case. I carry the Fenix all day at work and I forget it is even on my hip.

89,R3HD31MJA2E7B,True,PD32 LED Flashlight by Fenix,"The PD 32 is a good flashlight. More in line with what I was willing to spend after losing my Surefire flashlight. The PD 32 is small, bright and has control features my surefire did not have. A critically important feature is the place to secure a lanyard. Surefire does not always do this. The Fenix PD32 also casts a wider beam that allows for a better sense for ""the big picture"" at night when you are scanning for objects/obstacles. I have decided that a good strategy to buying a quality flashlight like a Fenix is to buy a smaller light like the Streamlight Microstream to go along with it. That way the more expensive light lasts longer in better condition and retains it's battery power reserves for bigger jobs. It also allows your more expensive hard to replace flashlight(s) to stay in your gear more an less likely to get seen, stolen or lost, like my surefire. With the PD32 there is a slight gap in width of the inside of the flashlight that allows the battery to wiggle around a bit.

91,R3K1XDK5G2CB1N,True,Well Beyond Exceeding Expectations,"I wasn't sure what to expect when receiving this flashlight. I've had a few very basic LED flashlights, and was never overly impressed. I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on this purchase, because this flashlight makes the others seem like toys. I was a little concerned with the light weight (it's much lighter than I expected), and even with the batteries it's easy to hold for long periods of time. The light output is almost unbelievable. If I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe it was possible for something so little to be so bright. Even on the lowest setting it provides more than enough light in most situations. The 'secret' SOS setting is cool (although I hope I never need it), and the turbo strobe mode will disorient anyone who gets too close.

The only difference that I find between the description and the actual model is the way you cycle through the different modes. According to the description (and the included instructions), you are supposed to depress the thumb switch multiple times to access the different modes. This particular flashlight has a memory of the most recent setting and when using the thumb switch, it automatically turns back on in this mode. The setting is changed by the switch on the side of the device; low, medium, high, turbo. If you hold the switch for one second it automatically goes into turbo strobe mode. If you hold if for three seconds, it switches to SOS mode.

I personally like this method better, as the side switch is easier to press when holding the flashlight.

I really can't say enough about this little flashlight; if you're looking for a light-weight, blindingly-bright flashlight that exceeds all expectations, this is the one to buy.

The only downside would be the batteries. They are not included, they are a little hard to find, and they are expensive. Looks like I'll be getting the rechargeable 18650 battery soon.

101,R3VG0F22FPNNGL,True,Not as good as the PD30R5,"Before this I owned a PD30R5. I decided to buy this one because of the momentary on switch. While that is a nice feature, in exchange, the brightness settings have been moved to a button toward the front of the light. Unfortunately this button is almost impossible to hit with one hand. I always seem to have trouble finding the location of the button due to the fact that the belt clip swivels around and is never in the same spot. This makes it almost a chore to change the brightness of the light and is often not able to be done quickly like it was able to do on the PD 30. Another thing that is a negative about this flashlight is the tail cap sticks out further than on the PD 30. This means that it is much easier to turn on by accident when in your pocket or in a belt holster.

114,R10MS4HLG8HHWZ,True,Excellent little light,"I have to admit, I am a whore for Surefire, I've got their lights mounted to weapons and stashed in most of my vehicles. I needed a new light to use this winter while walking the dog, and as such wanted it to have a crenellated bezel in case I ever had to use it as an improvised weapon. After looking at the Surefire E2D defender and this light I decided to go with the Fenix as it was about 1/3 the cost of the Surefire and offered a higher output.

After receiving this I am pleased. The light is bright, with a decent reflector that leaves no glaringly bright or dark spots. The body is rugged and the size and weight allow me to clip it to a pair of track pants or shorts and run without it dragging them down or causing any type of discomfort. This is an excellent light for the money.

My issues with it are as follows:
- The pocket clip could be a little tougher, and fastened to the light better. I am not particularly afraid of it falling out of a pocket that it's clipped in, but I wouldn't trust the clip to hold it if clipped on the outside of a bag or a belt.
-The switch to change the light modes is in an odd place, it requires you ro re-index the light in your grip feeling around for the rubber button if you wish to change the output.
-The bezel is crenellated, but not deeply enough in my opinion, had they made them more pronounced it would have been better as a backup weapon.

130,R1VYS7H6Y8GO4B,True,Uhh...wow,"Hi, my name is Mark and I'm a flashlight junkie. It's true, ask my wife. Because of this I feel qualified to say that this is one hell of a good little light. If you're reading reviews on it you've probably already checked out all of the spec's so I won't drone on about them. Let's stick to the basics. It has all of the features that you want in this type of light, four brightness modes, strobe, and S.O.S. mode. The different brightness modes make it perfect for everyday carry. On the lowest setting it produces just enough light to see while you're skulking around in the dark without alerting the entire neighborhood. The next two settings provide enough light to take care of most any other situations in which you might find yourself in need of light. The brightest, or ""turbo"" setting is nothing short of amazing for a light that weighs next to nothing and fits in the palm of your hand. On strobe the light alternates between a fast and slow strobe, my son says that it's very disorientating....poor little guy. I really haven't used the S.O.S. function, but if I ever find myself adrift at sea, or clinging to the side of a cliff in the dark it might come in handy. The on/off switch is located in the tail cap. It's dual function, on/off and momentary, it has a very positive actuation, I really don't think you'll have any issues with it turning on by accident. The best feature is the function switch used to cycle between modes. It's located on the side of the light just behind the bezel. It's easy to locate and easy to use. It makes changing modes a simple operation. Another nice feature is the memory, it will restart in the same mode that it was in when it was shut down so you can actually ""program"" the light to come on at whatever brightness level you want.(It will NOT come on directly in strobe or S.O.S. modes however) The bezel also has crenelations, and while I think that they are functional, they aren't very sharp. The light it produces is very white with no dark spot in the center, and while it lights up a very large area on the brightest settings, the beam is very clear and focused. I haven't had the light long enough yet to get a good idea of battery life. The bottom line is that this is, especially taking into account the low cost, a fantastic little light.",the united states,"April 6, 2012",Shenanigans,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:30:31.839712,2020-11-12 11:30:31.993143,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

131,R2HWWL7MTJDV65,True,As good as my SureFire Defender at half price,"Wow this is an exceptionally good light at this price!
In build quality it is pretty much indistinguishable from my SureFires - high quality aluminum with o-ring seals and excellent switching.
The light output at brightest is just a tiny bit less than my SureFire Defender E2D Defender and it is a significantly wider beam than the E2D's much more focused beam. I do prefer the SureFires narrower beam.
The four brightness level switch on the barrel is a great feature and easily accessed in use. It's a bit cheap looking but should hold up well.
The only con is the included case - very flimsy and the light could fall out if not pulled to its tightest closure. I'd suggest replacing the case with the far sturdier SureFire case but at this price it's a great deal.

138,R1K01VK47P4PSB,True,Fenix PD32 Flashlight,"I drive a cab in Ithaca, NY. I need a good flashlight to see house numbers late at night. I had been using a Maglite, but one night a guy got in my cab with a Fenix flashlight, and he showed me how bright it was, and he told me all about Fenix flashlights. His Fenix flashlight was so bright that I could turn off my cab's headlights and drive down West King Street through the woods behind Ithaca College at 2AM with just the Fenix flashlight pointed at the dark road ahead to see the way. I was impressed! But I did not think any flashlight was worth $100. But then, I had a sudden windfall, and since I have not been 100% pleased with the Maglite, I ordered a Fenix PD32 from Amazon.

The Fenix PD32, at 315 Lumens, is not as bright as the Fenix flashlight that that guy in my cab had, but it is bright enough to light up the front of a dark house in the woods. It seems to be a very good flashlight. It also is much smaller than I expected, which is fine. I had some trouble turning on my Fenix PD32 when I first got it. I had to tighten the end cap extremely tightly to get the batteries to make contact. That seems abnormal to me. In fact, I wondered if I'd gotten a knock-off.

But once I got it working, I was impressed! The PD32 is great!

Surprisingly, CR123A batteries are not easy to find in my area. I searched for a local store that sells them on the Internet. Only one store had them, the CVS Pharmacy on West Clinton Street. And they only had one package of two on the battery rack when I got there. I've never had a use for CR123A batteries before. They cost me $15 for a package of two. Pretty expensive little buggers! But I bought them. I wanted to use my Fenix PD32 right away. I'll probably buy rechargeable batteries and a charger, eventually.

The Fenix PD32 is a great flashlight, but I am not convinced it should be priced at $75. That still seems like a lot of money for a flashlight to me! But it does not disappoint, as well it should not, for that kind of money.

I may splurge again on another Fenix flashlight, now that I've been able to use the PD32 as an example in the field. I would like a more powerful, even brighter model. I also would like one with an adjustable beam, one that goes from flood to narrow, if Fenix sells such a flashlight.",the united states,"February 27, 2012",W. E.

144,R5HI8240XMEY7,True,Perfect for law enforcement,"I'l start off by saying I work in law enforcement and I bought this light to use on duty. I wanted a tactical light that I could clip on to my body armor or pocket, and use as a backup to my department issued flashlight, which is a Streamlight Polystinger. I spent a lot of time researching before I made a decision, and finally picked the Fenix light because of the high lumen output and good reviews.

I also purchased a Maximal Power FC18650 Rapid Dual Channel Charger, and a 2 pack of 3.7v 3000mah Ultrafire 18650 Rechargeable Batteries. I didn't want to keep buying 2 CR123A batteries, as they're really expensive.

I received the flashlight very quickly and have used it now, with the aforementioned batteries and charger, for about a month. I have never written a review on a product until now, and have never been so thrilled with a product. The light is durable, the clip is strong (you need to loosen it up a little as it is hard to clip in to your pocket at first), the light output is ridiculously bright, the throw of the light is pretty far, and the area of the light thrown is very large. My Streamlight has a very directed and focused beam, but the Fenix is much brighter and lights up more area. I now use the Fenix as my primary and the Streamlight as my backup.

This tactical light is the perfect size to use in combination with a pistol. My only gripe is the mode selector button placement is hard to reach if your using different pistol/flashlight grips, like the cigar technique, or even the ""Harries"" technique. This is, however, a nonissue because you shouldn't ever have to change the mode when using the light in combination with a pistol - unless you want to disorient someone with the strobe, which seems silly to me... It's still workable, just a little hard to find with your pinky while gripping the flashlight.

For LEOs, this light is perfect if you have someone detained and need to search them in the dark while having both hands free. You just turn the light on and clip it to the outside of your shirt or vest, and it will pretty much light up everything in front if you. The lowest intensity setting is low enough for reading/writing in your vehicle at night without destroying your night vision, or making yourself visible from the outside.

I use this thing every night and it has not disappointed or failed me once. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good, small, dependable light. I thought it would be my backup, but now it's my primary.",the united states,"January 17, 2013",KC,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:30:36.932641,2020-11-12 11:30:37.058882,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

234,RZWWC0NWQNT73,True,I love this flashlight (so does my wife)- revised,"I am a flashlight junkie. Fenix has put the on/off switch in back, fine, just like everybody else. Their toggle switch is near the front, where your thumb can hit it easily and quickly, very intuitively. No strobe- we don't often need to disable an attacker. I don't want a strobe. Buy the rechargeable 18650 batteries and charger as well- they beat replacing the 123s and the price is great. Back to the flashlight- on/off is set where you left it last.

We have bought six as gifts to people who matter to us. Thanks Fenix!

Months later this is still the finest flashlight I've ever owned. Both Fenix and Browning have bigger/brighter flashlights that are great for the bedside or truck, but this doesn't take up any room- easy to keep in any pocket. The batteries are great too.

260,RULUFDN1YY1ID,True,Pint-Sized Lighthouse,"I'm not a numbers guy, I work my tools hard and believe that if it's going to break it's not worth my time or money.

That being said.. I've beat the hell outta this light. One of the other reviewers mentioned he ran over it with his Jeep, so of course I embraced the he-man mentality and ran over it with a one ton diesel and the PD32 just laughed at me and kept shining. For the size, it vastly outshines my buddies E2D Surefire Defender (although I prefer the more pronounced impact bezels on the Surefire product), and it is easier on the batteries then his as well (for clarification I run Tenergy 1400mah CR123a) and I was able to get 202 hours out of the 9 lumen mode which has been perfect for the power outages I've been encountering thanks to mother nature and downed power lines. All other estimates were within 10 minutes of advertised run time.

I can also agree with the other reviewers on the waterproof abilities of the light and the fact that despite extended run times the surface of the light remains cool to the touch.

Originally I was hesitant as the body of the light is made in China, but I've pulled it apart multiple times now and the machining and quality are equal to Surefire as far as I can tell (heavy duty truck mechanic). They even include a spare O-ring and push button boot.

Pros:
Brighter then Surefire Defender of comparable size
Cheaper then Surefire Defender
Included parts
The memory circuit that stores the last used light level is excellent
GREATLY improved over PD31 - PD32 has temporary push button for light just like Surefire Defender and the toggle switch on the side allows one handed operation in place of the PD31 and turning the head
Over 100 lumens brighter then E2D defender

Cons:
Smaller impact bezels (again, personal preference. But it is easier on your pants' pocket)
Tailcap isn't even so you can't stand it up to serve as a candle

I was a Surefire guy, had a E2D before it decided to grow legs and wander off, but for the price and performance I can find no flaws for this light. Will most certainly be looking to Fenix for my future tac lights.

267,R3U2RLHJ5BNVI3,True,0 for 2 on the PD32,"I was looking for a flashlight to carry with me for my mountain bike excursions. I wanted a compact, bright, good performing LED light without resorting to purchasing another one of the top tier lights, being that this will be kept in my bike pouch and not be used that often. I came across the Fenix PD32. It thought it was exactly what I was looking for; a bright LED light, uses CR123A lithium batteries like my other lights, etc. I decided to order it.

I loved it the second I turned it on. It was compact, light, and felt of decent build quality. After using it for a few weeks, it stopped working. I immediately emailed customer service using the email address from the Fenix website. I also remember reading some reviews with tail cap switch issues from another light, so I inspected the switch, checked electrical contacts making sure it was tight, trying different batteries, and so on. No luck. A few days have passed and still no reply from Fenix support, so I decided to exchange it for another. The second one arrived, but this time it only worked for one day before the tail cap switch stopped working all together. It did not ""click"" any more and the switch did not spring back. I decided to return this one and look for another option. It has been a few weeks and still have not heard anything from customer support.",the united states,"June 6, 2012",Crimson,1.0,0,2020-11-12 11:31:44.276966,2020-11-12 11:31:44.402763,Fenix Pd32-R5 Cree Xp-G Led Flashlight,4.5,129.65,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0062PVSGW,,"#582,441 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

268,R3A0M23YF7WCTC,True,Buyer beware,"This flashlight worked well for just under one year, then when I needed to depend on it during a 3 week vacation, it simply stopped working.
