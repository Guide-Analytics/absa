0,R170NM9RJ5EM6P,True,"Cheap build quality, turns on in pocket","This flashlight isn't robust enough for a keychain. The frame of the light is cheap chrome plated plastic and the aluminum panels are just super thin and screwed into the plastic frame.

13,R1XUETOR2PQLQH,True,Potentially dangerous keyring torch,"The appeal of so much light from such a small keyring torch inspired me to buy one. The attraction turned into dismay when I came to use it. Firstly, the switches are fiddly and are the push down type. The various settings worked fine and the maximum 380Lm is impressive, albeit, you have to keep your finger on the switch to attain that. Later on I was to discover a design flaw with the switch configuration that could cause harm in different situations. I normally carry my keyring in my trouser pocket with other loose ends. I was driving my van when I became aware of a shocking heat against my leg that would have caused injury had I not stopped quickly. The switches had been depressed in my pocket causing the light to come on and start generating heat from the 380lm torch. Ok, so don't put it in my pocket. Problem solved. Until I came to recharge via the usb cable that didn't come with the torch. I left the torch to recharge and came back to find it switched on and very hot. I unplugged it and switched it off. It switched itself back on again and continued to do so every time I turned it off. I placed it outside on a non combustible surface until the battery was depleted. I would rather not imagine what may have happened if I hadn't noticed its peculiar behaviour. Though the idea of so much light in such a small device is appealing I would avoid this keyring torch at all costs. It is dangerous and unpredictable.",the united kingdom,"February 22, 2019",Big G,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:17:29.349063,2020-11-12 14:17:29.483842,NITECORE TINI 380 Lm Super Small USB Rechargeable LED Keychain Flashlight,4.3,39.15,,,B077Q5SS4X,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eH-Bi96-L._AC_SX425_.jpg
14,R3ND2RC88L1QDJ,True,Nitecore TINI,"Way over-priced. It doesn't come with a usb charging cable. Cannot lock on turbo; you have to keep pressing switch. Nothing to stop water getting through the switches into the electronics. The whole thing feels cheap and switches rattle around. Not as well made as other Nitecore flashlights and I have many of them. One of my favourite brands but this is not like the quality of the others.At this price it should come with a small charging adaptor and be better made, perhaps out of aluminium, rather than the cheap plastic that it appears to be made out of. To me it is worth between £5 and £10 and it feels cheap and flimsy. Some of my flashlights cost hundreds of pounds and they are worth every penny. This feels like something you could buy in a pound shop..
This has been a big disappointment from Nitecore. Many brighter, smaller and cheaper, similar flashlights that are much better value for money are available elsewhere. If this was my first experience of Nitecore I wouldn't buy that Brand again but I have about 50 of their flashlights and many of their batteries and 6 of their chargers and mostly they are all fantastic. I wonder how long the two switches on this will last...
I can only imagine that most of the reviewers here have nothing similar to compare this too.
Now dropped down to 1 star as the battery no longer holds charge for more than a few days, when switched off and locked. Having to charge it every other day, when it isn't even being used. Now using nitecore TUP and small olight which seems much better although not as small. The switches have now failed. This has never been exposed to water or damp. I opened it to see if I could fix it and the design is absolute garbage and these are all prone to fail with normal use. The switches just rest on the contacts and held in place by the cut outs on the casing. Slight expansion or contraction of internals or casing or screws seem to cause the switches to malfunction. I fixed it by squashing the internals and not tightening the screws up as tight as they were! The case does not look bent or damaged in any way.
Now it works but I am not confident in using it and know its build quality to be terrible so it is no longer being used.",the united kingdom,"July 11, 2018",Dom,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:17:29.489285,2020-11-12 14:17:29.641015,NITECORE TINI 380 Lm Super Small USB Rechargeable LED Keychain Flashlight,4.3,39.15,,,B077Q5SS4X,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eH-Bi96-L._AC_SX425_.jpg

23,R2J3Y7OTLUTQX8,True,"Klein, leicht und hell","Meine Einschätzung nach ein paar Tagen Gebrauch:
Die ""Tini"" ist interessant für Leute, die eine Mini-Lampe suchen, die so leicht ist, dass man sie täglich mitnimmt und kaum in der Hosentasche spürt, aber eine zeitlang (4h) hell genug leuchtet, um auch durch den Wald zu stapfen.
Pluspunkte:
+ kleines Gewicht u. Größe: Lt. Hersteller 13,4 g ohne Karabiner, etwa soviel wie eine 20-Cent u. 50-Cent-Münze zusammen wiegen (13,5 g)
+ Der breite Lichtkegel, der durch die Diffusoroptik erzeugt wird, ist sehr gut für den Nahbereich geeignet
+ Die Abstufung der Helligkeitsstufen (1/45/145/380 Lumen) finde ich sinnvoll. Mit 1 Lumen kann man einen Schlüssel ins Schloss bugsieren oder in einem Raum Gehen ohne gegen die Möbel zu stolpern. Mit 45 Lumen bin ich im Wald spaziert ohne über Wurzeln oder Steine zu stolpern. 380 Lumen sind so hell, dass man die ""Tini"" Kindern nicht zum Spielen geben sollte.
+ Die zwei Tasten haben eine gute Haptik (Druckgefühl). Die Bedienung konnte ich mir leicht einprägen.
Nachteilig oder fragwürdig:
- Die winzige Schriftgröße der mitgelieferten Bedienungsanleitung ist eine Frechheit!
- Die Kappe des Micro-USB-Ports ist mit sehr dünnem Material mit dem Gehäuse verbunden. Mal schauen wie lange das hält. (Ich weiß auch nicht, ob man es besser konstruieren könnte.)

27,R2AGUD9VBKQQ8R,True,Torcia molto compatta e versatile,"Si tratta di una torcia a led, con batteria integrata e carica tramite porta usb, dalle dimensioni molto contenute: si può collegare ad un portachiavi e tenere in tasca senza disagi di sorta.

Il prezzo non è dei più contenuti, ma le specifiche giustificano a mio avviso il costo: il costruttore dichiara una potenza luminosa massima di 380 Lumens, resistenza alle cadute fino a 1,5m, e una protezione da acqua/polvere rispondente allo standard IP54.

Vi sono quattro livelli di potenza luminosa selezionabili: 1, 38, 145 e 380 Lumens. Alla potenza minima l'autonomia dichiarata è di 60 ore, che scendono a 15 minuti a quella massima.

Fortemente consigliato, in quanto può sempre tornare utile, ed è certamente più versatile del flash/torcia degli smartphone.",italy,"March 29, 2019",hbd,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:17:38.112642,2020-11-12 14:17:38.352315,NITECORE TINI 380 Lm Super Small USB Rechargeable LED Keychain Flashlight,4.3,39.15,,,B077Q5SS4X,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eH-Bi96-L._AC_SX425_.jpg

29,R36B2B5J5A2WZ5,True,"Stopped working after a few months, and interface issues","Broke after a few months usage (would still illuminate, but only at ~1 lumen, so essentially useless). When it worked, it was exceptionally bright and it's as tiny as its name would lead you to believe, so I guess that's something ... but not much use if it doesn't last. This is the second nitecore light that I've had break on me, and I'm very careful with my gear -- I'm not impressed.

Even if it hadn't broken, though, I'd still not be using it. The user interface (particularly the two-second long press to turn on) is horrible.

Segnalo che ha due modalità di funzionamento, una in cui una volta accesa resta accesa finquando non si preme nuovamente il tasto di accensione e l'altra in cui lo spegnimento è temporizzato e avviene automaticamente.

It feels quite solid and seems to have better runtime.
The TINI is of course smaller and winds up being the one I use more often. I prefer its controls since it remembers last light level when you turn it back on. TINI also has a lower 'dim' setting so I am not worried about using it in the bedroom after significant other is already asleep. Using it mostly in the mornings getting ready for work before sun is up and finding stuff in dark areas like car,closet, backpack but it still has that bright setting to light up the outdoors too.

89,R19UOG9X7ZCX19,True,Great little light.,"Bought this for an Xmas gift but tried it out before sending it on its way (friend asked me to get them a good light, wanted to verify quality). This light is pretty much exactly what it bills it’s self as: tiny and very bright.

I have and use a lot of EDC flashlights. My go to is a solid brass110 lumen lumintop aaa that I wear as a necklace which till now was by far the best light I’ve found. By comparison I can’t say this light is 3-4 times brighter (it’s at least a bit brighter and seems comparable to an old multi D mag lite) but it is about 1/3 the weight and half the size. I knocked a star off because it feels just a bit cheaply made (though that may just be in my head coming from my current light), doesn’t seem quite as bright as advertised (though again I could only measure by rough comparison), and I’m just not a fan of the way the buttons work (they aren’t bad just not stellar).

There are larger keychain lights that put out up to 1000 lumens, but that is probably more light than you generally need from a keychain light and they tend to be on the bulky side (key fob size).

This light hits an ideal midpoint in size and lumens. Small enough to almost disappear in pocket with more than enough lumens to light the way in the dark.
