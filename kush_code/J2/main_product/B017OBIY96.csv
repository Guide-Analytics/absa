17,RZC086TD800EV,True,I can't recommend this light,"It includes a USB cable but there's no place to plug it in. Why??

I tried two 18650 batteries with button top. The first battery will only work if I unscrew the back cap a half turn. Otherwise it won't turn on. That is a Pelican battery, good quality. The second battery will only work if I jiggle the back cap or unscrew it slightly (not a half turn like the Pelican, maybe just a quarter turn). If I just tighten it down then the light will only sometimes turn on. I also ordered two Panasonic batteries for this light but they haven't arrived yet so I don't know if they will be any better.

That's too bad. This seems like a good light, if it worked. Compared to my $109 Pelican 7600 this one is much smaller and just as bright. But it's not working correctly so I can't keep it. The Pelican 7600 is perfect other than the larger size.

I just ordered the MH12GT with built in charger. Hopefully that one will work without having to loosen the rear cap.

Quick update... I just received the MH12GT and that light is fantastic. Absolutely awesome. I think I just got a bad P12GT but I'm happier with the MH12GT anyway because it has the built in charger and seems to be the same size -- if not it's extremely close in size.",the united states,"December 24, 2017",Kirby Miller,2.0,0,2020-11-12 14:32:10.515975,2020-11-12 14:32:10.795076,"Nitecore P12Gt Flashlight Cree XP-L Hi V3 LED-with Free Andrew & Amanda Pen, 1000 lm",4.5,100.73,,Tools & Home Improvement,B017OBIY96,,"#137,763 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

18,R2J3M6PA0IIW92,True,Awesome tube light.,"Unlike many of the generics and knockoffs on Amazon, Nitecore is recognized by flashlight enthusiasts as a legit (though perhaps a bit overpriced) flashlight company. As a city dweller, even with all the other light around this one is pretty amazing to use. Easily lights up to the end of my block. It's like taking a portable spotlight to the park. Easily fits in my pocket. 4 stars because it definitely doesn't reach the 300+ yards nitecore claims, somewhere in the 200s. I compared it to the  EagleTac DX30LC2 CREE XP-L HI V3  and while the eagtac claims 1160 lumens vs this nitecore's 1000 I could not notice a difference just eyeing it.
The Side switch is a huge plus for me. You still use the bottom switch to turn it on, but the side switch to go through the various modes. I hate using bottom clickers to rotate through various modes.
I'd say this is the easily one of the best flashlights you can buy in the $70 range. Uses an 18650 battery, I definitely recommend using a US based retailer for buying 18650 batteries, you do not want to wind up with a low quality generic or counterfeit.",the united states,"February 27, 2016",Dan,4.0,0,2020-11-12 14:32:10.807072,2020-11-12 14:32:11.031324,"Nitecore P12Gt Flashlight Cree XP-L Hi V3 LED-with Free Andrew & Amanda Pen, 1000 lm",4.5,100.73,,Tools & Home Improvement,B017OBIY96,,"#137,763 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

19,RRKI5SKBCIN1K,True,Nitecore stands behind their products,"Buy with confidence, Nitecore honors lifetime warranty.
I bought SRT5 flashlight a couple of years ago and carried it every day. It survived many falls, mud, and water. However a couple of weeks ago it quit after a fall from 1.5 feet. I contacted Nitecore via email and they asked me to contact and send the light to Edison Bright, the distributor I had bought it from. Edison Bright gave me the return instructions, I returned the light and today received a brand new one. Great service, especially considering that SRT5 is no longer available (at least on Amazon).

In the meantime I ordered P12Gt. So far it works fine and was in my pocket every day while I was waiting for SRT5 replacement. I like the tactical ring. It also solved a problem I reported with SRT5. I attached the lanyard to the ring, instead of the whole on the tailcap. This allows me to stand the light on its tailcap, which is useful for turning it into a lantern. Not a big deal, but sometimes convenient.

I do find SRT5 ring more useful to switch modes than the side button on PT12. SRT5 allows to select the mode or light intensity prior to turning it on, whereas you must switch on PT12 and then adjust brightness. PT12 remembers the last setting, so if you set it to low mode, turned it off, and than back on, it will be on low mode. I like to carry the light on max brightness for tactical reasons. However, in many situations and especially at night in-doors or in a tent i want it on on a low setting. Easy to do with SRT5, can't do with PT12Gt.",the united states,"August 17, 2018",sgt_pvo,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:32:11.033542,2020-11-12 14:32:11.264781,"Nitecore P12Gt Flashlight Cree XP-L Hi V3 LED-with Free Andrew & Amanda Pen, 1000 lm",4.5,100.73,,Tools & Home Improvement,B017OBIY96,,"#137,763 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

20,RNI4CV8NAQRN,True,My Favorite go to flashlight,"Love this freakin flashlight. Fits well in a front pocket and goes everywhere with me. The light output is unbelievable. My friend is always bragging about his Streamlight (double the price). Showed him the output and he was blown away. This thing is tough as nails. It came with 2 CR123 batteries. I have been using it for a few months now on those same batteries and have noticed no decrease in output. I like that it is 18650 compatible. Those batteries are cheap, rechargeable, and last forever. Will switch to them once the originals wear out. Just enough weight to it that it could be used as a weapon in a pinch. The tailcap switch is a feature that you wont want to do without. My last one did not have this and I was always searching for the switch on the barrel.

21,R37A35C6VSMLZR,True,Fantastic,"The product is excellent. I like the fact that the manufacturer stands behind the product.....because, after a year or so, it started to mis-behave. The U. S. seller (in Austin, Texas) was very helpful, and replaced the head at no charge. Works great now.

This is a very good tac light. When I first tried it, I could light up objects over 100 yards away in the Arizona desert. It gets a bit hot when you do that, but now I run at a lower power, knowing that I can use full brightness when I need it.

Throw: I go hiking often and at night, the ability to illuminate a hill 350-400m out is very helpful at night when trying to decide which route to take. I have no trouble making out details at 75-150m, and at 200m+ I can see major features near the hotspot, and a decent amount in the food.
Battery life: honestly depends on what 18650 you get, but in my experiences with the light, I can get a full two days of hard use before having to charge it.
Durability: solid solid solid! My previous light has been dropped 30ft, submerged, scraped and subjected to temperatures of 106F with no damage besides character marks (minor scratches).
Overall I love the light and I would highly recommend it to someone who needs a durable light or an edc light.",the united states,"November 7, 2017",Ramenspazz,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:32:14.299122,2020-11-12 14:32:14.445146,"Nitecore P12Gt Flashlight Cree XP-L Hi V3 LED-with Free Andrew & Amanda Pen, 1000 lm",4.5,100.73,,Tools & Home Improvement,B017OBIY96,,"#137,763 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

Compared to the P10, the P12GT's light is a more clearly defined circle and brighter at the highest setting. It also has a longer throw distance.

Thought the P10 lasts a lot longer and is easier to control with the mode lever button, the P12GT serves well for when I need more performance over longer distances.

66,R36E46XY69KWFS,True,its like comparing a Galaxy S8 to a slide rule,"It is a flashlight. If you compare it to a flashlight of the early 1970s, its like comparing a Galaxy S8 to a slide rule. But its still just a flashlight for like, seventy bucks. I have no idea if it has tactical value. If someone is threatening me, and I shine it in his eyes, it may disorient him for a few seconds while I try and run away, or piss him off a lot more and then he also takes your flashlight as well as beating you.

However if you are tying to find some freshly laid dog eggs in a pile of fall leaves, it is the second best thing you can use other than a Seek Thermal cam, which literally makes it glow for you. Its fun to use for night photography and video as well, but it can overexpose the shot as whatever you are pointing it at is quite bright.

67,RTONZHHQV1RBG,True,WHERE IS MY PEN?,"Pros,
- Very narrow beam, (may be a Con if you want a flood)
- Very long distance throw,
- Very bright.
- The battery voltage indicator is a very nice feature that no one else has (that I know of) and is dead accurate as compared to a Fluke true RMS Multi-meter.
- It has a locator beacon feature that looks like a camera flash going off every 2 seconds.
- Mode button is raised and rubber, so its very easy to find by feel, even with gloves (though harder indeed)
- No ANOYING!!! strobe in the normal mode cycling (but can be easily programed as the first thing that comes on)
Cons:
- Has a ~500 ms delay when activated. Not IOL (Instant on lighting {Ref. movie 'The Money Pit'} :)
- Checkered knurling grip is too slippery, seems its just for looks, not for a non-slip grip.
- Tail cap does not taper inward to assist in slipping into a case or pouch or pocket, snags on everything- very annoying
- Tail stand is possible if your really careful and don't move or even blink cause if you do it will tip over.
- Only accepts 'button top ' batteries. So vapers beware, No compatibility with your Batteries.
-Oh yeah...No Pen, Damn it!

-Update 11-07-15 : So the light had to go back. I ran it on high (1000 lm) for a while and was expecting the heat sensor to shut it down or go to a lower setting, well it did, then went bright again, then went dim again and so on and so on. now it has 2 brightness levels, low and (almost) high. In other words as you cycle through the levels its low-High-High-High-low. The high is more like 700 lm though not full on 1000 like before. I think the heat protection feature failed and the circuit board suffered from overheating. sending back, Amazon has a new one on the way. So 3 stars for now",the united states,"October 27, 2016",D.
