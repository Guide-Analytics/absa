0,R752ZJS58R0SB,True,Solid flashlight and very bright!,"I've owned several Fenix lights before and have always been a fan of their products. This light is my first one to use something other than a AA or AAA battery. I was a bit skeptical of the 18650 battery at first but after a little research I found it to probably be the best form factor for this type of light. High output, long life and rechargeable. The light itself is very well made, sturdy and fit and finish is excellent. The light feels solid in your hand and isn't too heavy. The tailcap switch is easy to use for both momentary and on/off operation. The function or dimmer button is also easy to use to cycle through the different modes and brightness levels. I've since made this flashlight part of my primary EDC. I purchased several 18650 batteries and a charger to keep spares at home, in my truck and EDC bag. You can use two CR123A's if you don't have an 18650.",canada,"December 10, 2016",Mackay,5.0,9,2020-11-12 11:07:46.168440,2020-11-12 11:07:46.298441,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,"{'manufacturer': 'Open Air Brands', 'part number': '105657', 'product dimensions': '15.24 x 7.62 x 2.54 cm; 158.76 Grams', 'batteries': 'CR123A batteries required.', 'item model number': 'FX-PD35TAC', 'is discontinued by manufacturer': 'No', 'size': '5.5 in', 'colour': 'Black', 'material': 'Aluminum', 'power source': 'AC/DC', 'item package quantity': '1', 'number of pieces': '5', 'type of bulb': 'LED', 'brightness': '1000 Lumen', 'usage': 'Outdoor mode operation utilizes side switch for all levels, and rear switch simply turns on/off', 'included components': 'Item', 'batteries included?': 'No', 'batteries required?': 'No', 'battery cell type': 'Lithium Ion', 'warranty description': 'N/a', 'item weight': '158 g'}","#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1,R27V58JAGIGILQ,True,Remarkable!,"It is hard to describe the quality of these little guys. From the moment you pick it up, you have the feeling of quality. Details are finely crafted, everywhere you look.

And turning this unit on, is truly spectacular. The amount of light that comes out defies logic! How can such a small light produce such a bright light? You really have to experience it!

I keep one in the truck and one on my night stand. I find that I keep the ""memory"" of the unit at a medium level. That way, when it comes on, you have a ""normal"" flashlight level of lighting. With just the push of a button, you can increase that to an amazing level, but for the most part, I don't need that level.

These little guys really are the best flashlights I have ever owned. Yeah, they are not cheap. I can't argue that. But as with many things in life, you get what you pay for. In this case, you get a flashlight that will probably outlast you and perform without fail, every single time.",canada,"February 27, 2019",MFH Strange,5.0,2,2020-11-12 11:07:46.302431,2020-11-12 11:07:46.425143,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2,R2UPP5F0VIRH31,True,"Absolutely amazing flashlight, terrible sheath","So first of all, this is my second PD35 so my review is of both, and I want to tell you how I came to have two. My original PD35 (right side in the picture) was purchased locally about 6 years ago, I soon after purchased 2 Fenix brand 3400mAh batteries with a charger and have literally never had an issue with the flashlight or batteries since.
Last year few weeks before Christmas we got our first snowfall and I decided to go for a drive in it, upon returning home I noticed that my PD35 was missing (it was clipped to my belt with the pocket clip because the sheath had given out, more on that later).
I have had this flashlight with me basically every day of my life for 6 years now, so I immediately ordered a replacement.
Fast forward about 2 months and multiple snow storms later, the snow and ice had taken a bit of a cutting and as I am getting into my car one day I noticed something in the driveway embedded in the ice (see second picture, with flashlight shaped print in ice), lo and behold, it's my original PD35! I pry it out of the ice, click the button, and it's very dim, but it turned on! One charged battery later and it is working just as good as the day I bought it.
I am a avid mountain biker, hiker and skier, as well as an automotive service technician for the last 1.5 years. I have used this flashlight in the worst possible conditions, gotten it covered in many different chemicals and oils, I even used it inside the sand-blasting cabinet at work when the built in light gave out! And it has NEVER LET ME DOWN.
If you buy a Fenix PD35 you will never need another flashlight again so long as you don't lose it, end of story.

As previously mentioned the ONLY issue I have ever had is not with the flashlight itself, but the included sheath, both of the sheaths that came with my flashlights have fallen apart after several months of (hard) use, I wouldn't subtract a star for this as the flashlight is 150% deserving of a 5 star rating, but it would be nice to have a sheath that matched the quality of the light.",canada,"November 8, 2018",Nicholas P.,5.0,5,2020-11-12 11:07:46.430129,2020-11-12 11:07:46.563771,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3,R1268X2KBOYY8A,True,Stunningly bright,"But the batteries are not easy to find and too expensive. And the controls are simply dumb. The on / off is on the end and the brightness control is a small button on the barrel that has you fumbling with both hands to find it. An amazingly poor design. Not surprising, it gets hot after a couple minutes on high. The beam is not adjustable so the huge output of light, and it is huge, is spread on a fairly wide area. This means the distance the brightness reaches is limited. We have a Maglite that is only 300 lumens but the beam can be focused and the reach out is much better. I do not recommend this model.",canada,"August 22, 2018",B H Roberts,2.0,1,2020-11-12 11:07:46.567425,2020-11-12 11:07:46.700059,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

4,R23KRFFL92D1XY,True,Don't hesitate just buy this light now!,"I am a HUGE flashlight guy. And I love this light and this brand! This is my 6th Fenix brand light. I am a customer for life. The PD35 TAC is a great light for EDC and tactical use. The 1000 Lumen setting is extremely bright. I was able to light up a hillside over 200 yards out. It feels great in the hand. Easy to cycle through settings. I keep my light on 500 lumens at work and during the day and 1000 lumen tactical setting at night and on weekends. Be careful what you shine the light at as it is so bright that it reflects off some surfaces easily and you can temporarily blind yourself. The quality of this light is amazing as always with Fenix. I highly recommend this light to everyone looking to carry a flashlight for any reason. With lumen settings of 8, 60, 200, 500 and 1000 as well as 1000 lumen strobe there is a setting for every senario.
You will not be disappointed with this light. I can not recommend this light or brand enough.
If you get this light I also suggest getting one ore two 18650 rechargeable batteries. If you are like me and use 1000 lumen setting alot you will burn through a lot of CR123 batteries.

Also the pocket clip is really good quality and is by far the best clip I have had on any light including previous Fenix lights. It is really strong and stiff. You do not need to worry about losing your light.",canada,"August 15, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:07:46.704047,2020-11-12 11:07:46.810271,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

58,RMDDJIHU9IP0F,False,Very good light!,"I bought mine from fenix themselves because at the time the only sellers of them on amazon were 3rd party and fenix themselves said they were all china counterfeiters. I would buy from amazon themselves though. I wanna say to the fool who gave it a negative review because he had no idea how to work it and never bothered to read the instructions judging by his stupid comments that before you give it a negative review learn how to use the bloody item 1st! Therefore you don’t sound stupid. Ok this light does change to different lumin power strengths. The tail button is for off and on and the side button changes the modes. The reason is because a lot of lights change modes(powers/strobe) by the rear button and often switch to the main set mode by the factory. Now if you’re a cop you don’t want your flashlight to always start on eco. So the fenix system lets you put it in the power mode you want and then it’ll always be ready to go when you press the tail button. It works better than the other systems in my opinion. Now to anyone not sure about the 18650 batteries I can tell you that it’s far far superior to AA batteries. That being said it’s just like regular batteries, there’s great ones and crappy ones. Panasonic makes the best of them by far. Independent tests prove it. You can get a good Panasonic 18650 battery here on amazon. The more powerful the brighter your flashlight will be for longer. Obviously it won’t surpass the manufacturers output but it will get to that full output and stay at that far longer. For example using my light on eco mode which is I think 40 lumens I only charged my battery once in 6 months and others I’ve heard went 9 months. Remember it’s all going to matter how often & how long you use it for each use. I used mine everyday but only for minutes each time. Still 6 months is a long time. At the full 1000 lumens it lasts a decent amount of time. It’ll automatically switch down if it gets too hot. This is also a true 1000 lumens. Do not believe all those lights claiming 2500-18000 lumens because it’s a lie. A real 2500 lumens flashlight will cost at least $200 and a 4000 lumens light will be $350 or more. They also can start fires at those lumens if they didn’t switch down. There’s some made to stay at 2500 lumens so that you can use your flashlight to start a fire. Like for camping. So normal lights won’t stay at a high lumens level for long because of the high heat and fire risk. I saw a china manufacturer and seller on amazon selling a headlamp claiming it had 18000 lumens, hilarious! 1st the higher the lumens the more powerful battery power you need. Also 18000 lumens would severely burn your head. So do your research and don’t buy into all those fraudulent claims about super high lumens. Oh I should point out that there’s no safe cheap china made batteries that are high milliamps. The most common quality 18650 power is 2600-3500 mAh. Again do your research but the batteries most experts & even flashlight manufacturers use are Panasonic, Fenix, Nitecore, & Olight. Everything I’ve read & from my own experiences always keeps me going back to Panasonic. Again don’t just accept my opinion but do your own research. The better you get the more you’ll get out of it. My fenix flashlight is going strong after 6 years and that’s real world use. I’ve had to get a couple of batteries over that time but they all will eventually start to decrease in power. The best last the longest though & are the most reliable and safe for that matter. Bar a long long way. I’ve paid $35 for the battery but it was strong for over 2 years. I had cheap backups where I got 4 batteries for that price and they all together didn’t last a year! I was also scared charging them because of all the stories of cheap batteries exploding. It’s not worth going cheap. Save if you have to because remember pay a more once or pay less many times. It is my opinion but from my own experience I feel comfortable recommending this fenix pd35 tac flashlight to all. 6yrs and still going strong says a lot to me. By the way be careful using the strobe light because it’s 1000 lumens and it hurts even with your eyelids closed. The user can also go into a seizure from the strobe mode so be careful if you have epilepsy.",canada,"July 17, 2019",Canuck4Life,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:08:15.250003,2020-11-12 11:08:15.374028,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

61,RTYD3EIMYKH54,True,"Sturdy, practical, and very powerful","This came as a replacement to the PD30 I used to own, which unfortunately, it seems, might have burned out after I inserted the batteries the wrong way around. The PD35 has circuit protection features to prevent that. The button on the side is very useful to switch modes. The PD35 also runs much cooler than the previous model, which after a couple of minutes could grill your fingers. It has been dropped a few times, and it has resisted so far. The batteries last an eternity, but I do recommend using non-rechargeables if you don't have a spare pair of rechargeables all the time. They seem to last at three times as much, so if you're out and about with no access to your second pair or rechargeables, go for regular ones.

67,R2MAVUPD1YTD9M,True,Vergleich mit der Thrunite TN12,"Ich hatte seit 2014 die TN12 der Marke Thrunite in verschiedenen Versionen, nun kam es zum zweiten Mal zu einem Defekt, weshalb ich mich von Thrunite abgewandt habe.

Als Konkurrenz zur Thrunite kam für mich die Fenix PD35TAC und die Klarus XT11GT in Frage. Letztlich habe ich mich aus zwei Gründen für die Fenix PD35TAC entschieden 1. Der Preis und 2. Der taktische Modus.

Ich werde nun die einzelnen Eigenschaften der Fenix PD35TAC bewerten und mit der Thrunite TN12 2016 vergleichen.

Helligkeit:
Die Helligkeit nach Ansi-Standard wird bei der Fenix mit 1000 Lumen angegeben. Die Thrunite hingegen soll sogar 1100 Lumen erreichen. Ich persönlich konnte auch beim direkten Vergleich keine Unterschiede feststellen. Ich bin auch nach Jahren immer noch begeistert, wie viel Licht aus einer kleinen Taschenlampe kommen kann.
Unentschieden zwischen Fenix und Thrunite (beide 5 von 5)

Bedienung:
Im normalen Modus funktioniert die Fenix fast gleich wie die Thrunite. Anschalten mit dem großen Knopf am hinteren Ende der Taschenlampe, danach kann mit dem kleinen Knopf an der Vorderseite durch die verschiedenen Modi geschaltet werden. Fünf verschiedene Helligkeitsstufen und der Strobo Modus, hier wird in dem Modus in dem man ausgeschaltet hat auch wieder angefangen. Leider habe ich bei der Thrunite immer wieder am hellsten Modus vorbeigeschaltet, da ich teilweise nicht sicher war wann dieser erreicht ist.
Jetzt zum Hauptunterschied zwischen Fenix und Thrunite. Der taktische Modus, den nur die Fenix beherrscht. Diesen kann man durch 3-sekündiges halten des kleinen Knopfes am Kopfende der Taschenlampe aktivieren. Im taktischen Modus ist ausschließlich der große Knopf mit einer Funktion belegt.
Der Knopf kann auch ""halb"" gedrückt werden. Damit kann man im taktischen Modus zwischen drei Modi wählen, 1. Volle Helligkeit 2. Strobo 3. Ca. 50% Helligkeit.
Das Gute ist, sobald der große Knopf komplett gedrückt wird schält die Lampe Anfangs immer in den hellsten Modus.
Fenix schlägt Thrunite (Fenix 5 von 5, Thrunite 4 von 5)

Verarbeitung:
Beide Taschenlampen sind sehr gut verarbeitet und bestehen fast komplett aus Metall. Der einzige Unterschied ist der kleine Knopf an der Vorderseite der Lampe. Bei Fenix besteht der Knopf aus Metall, steht aber nicht sehr weit aus dem Gehäuse heraus, sodass er nicht so einfach gefunden werden kann. Bei Thrunite steht er weiter hervor, besteht aber aus Kunststoff. Des weiteren kann der Knopf bei Thrunite versehentlich gedrückt werden. Im taktischen Modus, den ich benutze ist der Knopf sowieso ohne Funktion, weshalb mir das Finden des Knopfs nicht so wichtig ist.
Fenix schlägt Thrunite (Fenix 5 von 5, Thrunite 4 von 5)

Zuverlässigkeit:
Das war für mich der aller wichtigste Punkt. Ich muss mich zu 100% auf meine Taschenlampe verlassen können. Das war bei meiner Thrunite nicht gegeben, sie hatte ab und an einen Fehler. Nachdem der Knopf losgelassen wurde ging die Lampe wieder aus. Dies geschah in ca. 10-15% der Fällen. Bei der Fenix ist das noch nie passiert. Den zweiten Kritikpunkt habe ich bereits unter ""Bedienung"" angesprochen. Bei der Thrunite muss immer wieder durch alle Modi geschaltet werden bis man den hellsten erreicht.
Fenix schlägt Thrunite (Fenix 5 von 5, Thrunite 3 von 5)

Fazit:
Helligkeit: Fenix 5 von 5 // Thrunite 5 von 5
Bedienung: Fenix 5 von 5 // Thrunite 4 von 5
Verarbeitung: Fenix 5 von 5 // Thrunite 4 von 5
Zuverlässigkeit: Fenix 5 von 5 // Thrunite 3 von 5

Fenix 20 von 20
Thrunite 16 von 20

Hier muss aber bedacht werden, dass die Fenix 15€ mehr kostet als die Thrunite.

Ich persönlich würde jedem die Fenix empfehlen. Wer aber nicht bereit ist die extra 15€ zu investieren, der ist auch mit der Thrunite gut bedient, zumindest solange diese 100% funktionsfähig ist.",germany,"March 31, 2017",MM10,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:08:20.641490,2020-11-12 11:08:20.787716,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

99,RT53SUQGZ0M3I,True,Super Hell und Handlich,"Die Taschenlampe ist super hell und ist mehr als ausreichend für fast alle Situationen.
Auf maximaler Stufe sogar oft zu hell da man im Dunkeln sofort jemand blendet oder man ist selbst geblendet wenn man einen reflektierenden oder weisen Gegenstand anleuchtet. Zusäzlich ist sie klein genug dass man sie überall mit hinnehmen kann.

Das Gewicht, die Verarbeitung und die Optik machen alle einen sehr guten Eindruck und es ist auch jetzt nach einem Jahr noch alles super.

Ein Punkt der mich jedoch immer wieder stört ist die ""kurze"" Laufzeit auf maximaler Stufe und dass sie dann langsam immer dunkler wird.
Da ich das aber nicht mit einer anderen so hellen Taschenlampe vergleichen kann und es evtl. nicht besser machbar ist, gebe ich hier keinen Punkt Abzug.

100,R1S23AUKI1SCQT,True,Preis-Leistung passt nicht,"Auf Grund guter Testberichte im Netz habe ich mir die FENIX, PD35 TAC gekauft!

Ich habe sie mit der chinesischen No-Name Leynatic LED-Taschenlampe verglichen!

Als die Fenix ankam war ich ziemlich enttäuscht, ich dachte es wären Batterien enthalten, komischerweise war bei manchen Nutzern welche dabei und bei anderen nicht! Aktueller Stand es sind leider keine Batterien enthalten, da steht auch kein Hinweis in der Beschreibung!

Mit der Bedienung kann ich mich nicht wirklich anfreunden! Am Ende befindet sich der Ein und Ausschaltknopf! Möchte man die Beleuchtungsstärke wechseln geht dafür nur der zweite Knopf vorne im Bereich Lampenkopf! Die Strobofunktion lässt sich nur im eingeschalteten Zustand aktivieren! In dem man den vorderen Knopf zweimal schnell drückt! Da ich die Taschenlampe gerne kopfüber halte, kann ich die Stobofunktion nicht mit dem kleinen Finger aktivieren bzw. der Lichtstärken wechsel funktioniert so nur schwer!

Die Taschenlampe lässt auch nicht als Notfalllampe auf den Tisch stellen, da der Einschaltknopf zu weit heraussteht!

Die Fenix kostet 59,90€ plus Fenix 468659 3500mAh 3,6V - 3,7V Li-Ionen Akku PCB 21€ plus Fenix ARE-C1 Ladegerät 32,95€, dass sind um die 115€! Das ist wirklich teuer!

Ich habe sie mit der chinesischen No-Name Leynatic LED-Taschenlampe verglichen die 19,99€ kostet und nur 800 Lumen hat! Komischerweise hält die No-Name Taschenlampe mit 800 Lumen in Sachen Leuchtkraft mit der Fenix mit 1000 Lumen mit ! Wie geht den dass? Der Zentrale Lichtpunkt ist tatsächlich bei beiden Taschenlampe identisch!

Für mich ist dass wirklich enttäuschend, der erste Eindruck ist nicht positiv! Gut finde ich nur, dass sie schön handlich ist, gut verarbeitet wirkt, Spritzwassergeschützt ist, der Akku entnehmbar ist und eine kleine Tragetasche dabei ist!

Aber in meinen Augen stimmt hier die Preis-Leistung nicht!

Auf dem Bild sieht man links die No-Name und rechts die Fenix!

Update 15.10.2018:

Ich werte die Taschenlampe um einen Stern auf! Sie ist doch deutlich heller als die No-Name!

104,R1TIL12SI8CT79,True,Erfüllt ihren Zweck,"Ich habe mir die PD35 TAC zugelegt um auf Wanderungen und bei Zeltlagern das Handy beziehungsweise die Fahrradlampe daheim lassen zu können.

Deshalb stellte ich mir folgende Anforderungen an das Produkt:
- Leichtes Gewicht, hohe Batterielaufzeit (bei 7-tägigen Zeltlagern wichtig!)
- Sowohl eine weite, sehr helle Ausstrahlung als auch ein nahes ""Nachtlicht"". Die weite Ausstrahlung soll insbesondere während nächtlicher Wanderungen der Orientierung dienen. Hingegen soll das Nachtlicht oder im Dixi-Klo eingesetzt werden ;-) Teilweise auch, um nahflächig Hindernisse zu erkennen oder um die Karte zu lesen.
- Ein Strobo-Effekt könnte die Abwehr krimineller Menschen erleichtern.. Oder die Abwehr von Tieren.

Obwohl die Wanderung erst in etwa einer Woche beginnt, habe ich gestern bereits schon einmal das Produkt getestet. Der Strobo-Effekt tut schon hinter der Taschenlampe im Kopf weh und sowohl das Nachtlicht ist ausreichend dunkel sowie auch das Fernlicht leuchtet bei über 200m Abstand die Gebäude aus.

Die Verarbeitung wirkt auch hochwertig und das Gewicht der Taschenlampe fällt in der Hosentasche gar nicht auf.

Problème alors que la lampe est comme neuve presque pas utilisée à l'extérieur.
Fabricant injoignable (voir avis très pertinent sur ce sujet ici même).
Impossible de voir la duree de garantie Amazon : aucune mension, retour plus proposé.
Après recherche sur internet je constate que le problème est connu pour différentes lampes torche Fenix, à savoir un fonctionnement heratique en début de vissage puis arrêt de la lampe en cours et fin de vissage.
Voir ma photo avec éclairage sur le début de vissage et la lampe qui fonctionne ainsi.

107,R3PBY76V55SUWI,True,FENIX PD35TAC - tolle Allrooundlampe ohne Spielereien,"Ich habe zum Vergleich die FD41 und die FD30 von Fenix bestellt:
Die PD35TAC ist eine tolle Allround-Lampe ohne viele Spielerein mit genialem Fernlicht. Das Nahlicht besteht einen einem hellen Punkt mit einem erkennbar dunklerem Hof.
Die FD30 besticht in der Flutlichteinstellung durch eine recht gleichmäßige Ausleuchtung des Nahbereiches und macht dabei genug Licht, um das Gelände bis zu 20m gut auszuleuchten. Im Fernlicht leuchtet die FD30 zwar genau so weit wie die PD35TAC, jedoch nur einen vergleichsweise kleinen Bereich aus - was mir persönlich nicht so gut gefallen hat.
Bei der FD41 muss man lichttechnisch keine Kompromisse machen. Das Flutlicht ist perfekt und kräftig ausgeleuchtet (noch besser als bei der FD30) und im Fernlicht steht sie der PD35TAC keineswegs nach. Einzig bei Größe und Gewicht muss man hier den Kompromiss eingehen. Die FD41 ist am Kopf spürbar größer und auch etwas schwerer.

178,RF4UG0CQ5MNOR,True,Compact and super bright,"Although I'm not a fully-blown flashlight fan, I do have a few and like a nice bright torch. I was a little apprehensive of spending a reasonable amount of money on a torch, however I was not disappointed.

For such a small torch, the output is staggering. I've read independent reviews online which do confirm the full 1000 lumens (or more) are produced, and it certainly seems that way. There are 5 brightness settings, with the front silver button indexing through and the back button allowing momentary or constant on lighting. You can also toggle to 'tactical' mode by holding down the silver button, which triggers the strobe feature at 1000 lumens. (Certainly enough to dazzle a would-be assailant at night, or even during the day, or to signal for help). I've tried the torch in a pitch black room and at full output, it's brighter than if every light were switched on. The beam itself cannot be adjusted or focused, but this is not really needed, as the light output is well focused (a wide, slightly dimmer outer beam, with a very bright central beam). The only downside is that the 1000 lumen brightness level will quickly eat up the batteries in only an hour, but this is not due to the torch, just the nature of the LED and on the lowest brightness level (10 lumens), the torch will last 140 hours.

The torch is nicely made from matte black anodised aluminium, with a small heatsink just behind the front section, which is certainly required, as on setting 4 and 5, quite a lot of heat is produced and can even be felt in front of the torch (surprising, for an LED). The power is electronically regulated for each brightness level and automatically drops from level 5 down to 4 and 4 down to 3 after pre-set time limits, so as not to cook the bulb. (it's possible, though inadvisable, to override these but turning off and on again). The front face of the torch is smooth, but has indented scallops as glass breaking sections. (so probably a useful torch to keep in the car for emergencies). There is an octagonal anti-roll section where the silver mode select button is located.

Flashlight comes in a small box, with one set of disposable lithium batteries provided, as well as a pouch with belt loop, a clip for the light (as shown in main photo) and a lanyard. Spare O-rings and a spare rear button are also included.

Overall, very impressed.",the united kingdom,"September 16, 2015",Snakeyjake,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:09:16.652320,2020-11-12 11:09:16.771004,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

249,RVN3MGOOVHYU2,True,Amazing,"This is a beast of a torch. I bought this as a go-to (kinda EDC type thing though I don't carry it absolutely everywhere).

Build Quality
It's a nice carry, sits nicely in the pocket with its heavy duty clip.
The construction is solid, anodising is very hard and scratch / chip resistant.
The lens is clear, the antireflective and antiscratch coatings appear to be very good and uniform.
The beam pattern is nice and circular, with no hot spots. There is a faint cold spot in the centre but only really noticeable when looking at uniform structures. Not an issue as very subtle.
The peripheral spread of the beam is nice and uniform, no messy leakage of light.
The brightness is sufficient for visualising small objects up to around 30 metres away and larger structures can be illumited from around 50m or so.

Modes
The strobe function is great - it's a variable strobe so it's not a predictable pattern, this makes it better for things like self-defence though I have no real need for this function.

You'll either love or hate the 'tactical mode' that the flashlight is defaulted to when shipped. The end clicky switch bascially gives you High-Strobe-Med by default, to access the other modes you have to hold down the other switch on the side of the body. I like this function as the mode I use the most is high and to get to medium for more close-up work such as map reading / accessing dark nooks and crannies is easy (my only gripe is having to go past the strobe mode to get to it). I haven't really used the non-tactical modes (low, etc) but I can see how this would be good in a situation where you need low-level lighting for long periods of time.

Power
I use Panasonic NCR18650NB 3400mAh cells in this, also bought from Amazon (see link) Panasonic NCR18650B Li-Ion 3400 mAh Cell Protected Battery (Pack of 2)

The battery life is good, I haven't had to replace them through lack of power though I regularly cycle the batteries through and keep them 'alive'.

Other Applications
1000lumens is more than enough though I wouldn't use it for cycling - it's too narrow in the beam spread so I use my Exposure Six-pack 2000lumen for this though I carry this as well for backup. I made a nifty bike mount from an old cycle pump mount and some hook'n'loop and it's reasonable for a emergency cycling light.

You can't stand this on its end - the knurling on the cap prevents this. I think this is a missed application though I have managed to create a base from Sugru rubber compound to get around this.",the united kingdom,"April 5, 2016",Pablo,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:09:58.448222,2020-11-12 11:09:58.576914,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

265,R3P7X1DLNI13E9,True,Hervorragende Lampe für den täglichen Einsatz,"Diese Version der PD35 ist bereits die dritte Inkarnation der PD35 Reihe. Die Urversion von 2013 hatte eine maximale Lichtausgabe von 850 Lumen, die Version von 2014 ""leistete"" 960 Lumen. Die aktuelle PD35tac wird mit 1000 Lumen im Turbo-Modus angegeben.

Wie bei allen diesen vergleichsweise schmalen und leichten Lampen können die Maximalwerte nur wenige Minuten gehalten werden, bevor die eingebauten Schutzschaltungen in einen niedrigeren Modus umschaltet. Die PD35tac verfügt über 5 Leuchtstufen, die vom Hersteller so angegeben werden:
1000 Lumen, für 1 Stunde 10 Minuten, 500 Lumen (2h 55min), 200 Lumen (8h 30 min), 60 Lumen (29h 15 min), sowie 8 Lumen (140h). Neu ist bei der tac Version, dass diese normale oder Outdoor Modus genannte Einstellung über den Seitenschalter auf den ""taktischen"" Modus umgeschaltet werden kann. Danach lässt sich die Lampe nur noch über den hinteren Klick-Schalter steuern und erlaubt noch genau 3 Modi.

1000 Lumen, Strobo, 60 Lumen. Dies lässt sich bereits nach wenigen Augenblicken sehr gut steuern. Wem diese Bedienung missfällt, kann über längeres Drücken des Seitenschalters zurück in den Outdoor-Modus wechseln.

Da ich bereits die Version von 2013 besitze, konnte ich beide Lampen einem Vergleich unterziehen. Die Helligkeitsunterschiede sind minimal - der Sprung von 850 auf 1000 Lumen rechtfertigt eine Neuanschaffung sicher nicht.Der Beam der ""alten"" Version ist etwas ausgedehnter und minimal dunkler, dies sind aber wirklich nur Nuancen.

Für mich bleibt die Fenix PD35 Reihe weiterhin eine der besten Taschenlampen, wenn man Lichtleistung und das (geringe) Gewicht berücksichtigt. Natürlich sollte man einen 18650 Akku einsetzen, um das volle Potential auszuschöpfen. Wichtig: der Akku sollte einen flachen Plus-Pol haben und nicht zu dick sein. Gerade die Akkus mit eingebauten Panasonic Zellen sind häufig zu voluminös.",germany,"July 30, 2015",Uwe,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:10:05.911923,2020-11-12 11:10:06.033475,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

Die PD35Tac ist wertig verarbeitet und hat kompakte Maße.
Das Umstellen in den ""Tac"" Modus mag man für gewöhnlich und bei ziviler Anwendung kaum benötigen, aber einen Stern ziehe ich ab, da der silberne Druckschalter zum Wechsel des Leuchtmodus im Dunkeln kaum zu sehen und nur sehr schwer zu erfühlen ist!

I have lights that cost in the $200 range for a rechargeable light, from coast, stream light, mag light, sure fire and the list goes on. This is hands down the best light I have ever owned and I put them through their paces. From being run over, to dropped from 7 ft to being used as a hammer to get something to act up or just move. I use my lights and admit I abuse them. my job is to get it done and get it done fast. I additionally carry this light for personal defense and carry a hefty firearm at all times concealed. This is my"" go to"" to know what goes bump in the night or just the dark places. It is super brite, super lite, powerful, long winded

At $150 I would gladly purchase this light again If I had to. $70 for this light, this is a smoking good light and I give it 6 stars out of 5.Im not paid to say this or brag. I'm just an ordinary guy that won't hesitate to tell ya that it's a POS when it is. But this light is 100% money well spent. Be sure to pick up extra batteries too.

The operating modes are useful and the light output is staggering. It's a car headlight in something the size of a large marker pen! It's strobe mode is very useful in a defensive situation (I presume).
My one and only crticism, and I'm being very picky, is the lack of a focussing mode but this unit is so efficient on flood that everything in front of the user IS illuminated so why bother focussing?

As soon as i opened the box and turned it on, ive had nothing but intermittent on and off issues as well as brightness control settings problems. Im very familiar with this light and used reccomended batteries necessary for it to operate properly. I am not the only one to experience these kinds of issues with this particular unit according to other reviews. I can honestly say when it works properly its an awesome light.

According to the company website and other videos, there are adjustments you can do in order for it to work properly. After trying everything and still no luck i decided to just return the item. After all, should i have to repair or tweek a brand new item from the box in order for it to work properly. I would hope not. I think this in an engineering problem that could be addressed. Even though i love the light and the brand, i just cant justify spending nearly seventy dollars on something so unreliable and labeled as Tactical.

350,R1PGVLD8JM94A9,True,Light weight reliable light but NO tail stand,"Love the light but for two things. Everything else is ideal. Size, weight, brightness and switch functions.
1. The holster provided will not hold this light, it is too tight. No one should need a third hand just to put their flashlight in the holster.
2. The should be able to stand on its tail but it does not. So if you need to here are possible solutions for you.
a. old old old film container
b. coin collector quarter stack container
c. sugar test strip container
I have all of these and tried them and they work well. Tip if you use the quarter storage container put 4 to 6quarters in bottom and it really stabilizes with the weight.
That said it is a good flashlight. Every person has different priorities and money they will spend. If you don't need a holster or you intend to buy a better separate one then you are golden.

354,R3RT2P3UDT5SL9,True,Batteries are NOT included with weaponized flashlight,"Weaponized flashlight. Confusions are instructing. Best set to mid power output for general use. You can use the side button to trigger strobe mode. Just hold it for three seconds. You've got the time. Then wham! 1000 lumens of very psychedelic strobe that will likely confuse anyone. Side switch turns that right off and puts you back to the previous illumination.

It could use a better heat sink. The light warms up fast. The end switch cap doesn't quit line up with the side switch. This makes pinky operation of the side switch more difficult, particularly with off hand. I presume you would want your strong hand available for chemical or kinetic energy weapon. Or perhaps just car keys if you haven't switched to proximity fobs yet.

I never use my dogs as self defense, they most likely would be hurt or killed along with me if we were attacked. I am licensed to conceal carry a firearm, and I am very well trained to defend myself if my life was at risk. I have been taught methods in identification, escape and evasion of potential dangers .

356,R1I0AJY4G7HQXS,True,Powerful/versatile tactical light!,"Hard to beat the lumens and candela/range of this, and splash/periphery is good. Super bright when you want, and beam is thrown hundreds of meters. I like the flexibility of 5 settings of lumens. Though keep in mind that high settings on this and some other flashlights burn batteries very quickly, so plan accordingly in how you use it, and/or stocking up on batteries.

Works well as a tactical light for low-light shooting drills- I wish this came in a weapon mounted version. Just keep in mind you should really practice a lot how to change the light settings if you’re going to in a tactical situation- or ideally leave it on one, lower setting if clearing a house. Lanyard is short and allows the light to be easily dropped if you switch to a weapon mounted light.

Dropped it accidentally at least once, and still works apart from mild scratches. Hard to beat the excellent waterproof rating.

357,R5B2CYB5VX4TK,True,The best small light I’ve owned.,"Packaged well and comes with detailed instructions to access the modes. Seems sturdy.

Photos... I started by taking a photo with no light in my yard. ⅓ acre. Narrow and deep. Then I started with the lowest brightness and took photos of the five levels of brightness on outdoor mode. Outdoor mode lets you cycle through the 5 brightness settings by tapping the side button. I followed the same steps with my cars. No light, then 5 levels of brightness.

Note: the 4th and 5th levels look the same in the photos, but Turbo mode(brightest) is noticeably brighter than the next setting down. I’m also pleasantly surprised with the throw and beam. Makes me forget that it can’t zoom. This light also stays put in my breast pocket of my work shirt using the clip that comes on it.

I put this light to the test by running it in turbo mode for at least 5 minutes. It eventually got hot, but you can still hold it. I kept it in the middle brightness setting for about an hour with no issues. I was changing the oil on my cars. Worked great. It was dark out, so it came in handy when I was filling the oil after draining. I used a fully charged 18650 battery.

There are more detailed instructions included than I will review in the next two paragraphs.

Tactical mode: this mode allows you to simply turn the light on and off with the tail button. It defaults to turbo mode (1,000 lumens). It’s super bright, and seems to be a legit rating. Remember that lumens eating is each diode, not overall output of combined diodes, so appearance may vary from various lights. This light has only one diode, yet is shockingly bright. Strobe setting in either mode will easily blind anyone looking at it.

Outdoor mode lets you turn the light on and off with a click of the tail button. The side button changes brightness with each tap, scaling up in brightness as you tap. It goes in this order... eco(8), low(60), mid(200) high(500), turbo(1,000).

The holster fits, and I will use it when I’m not wearing a shirt with pockets.

Pros:
Looks great

Tactical and outdoor modes are both useful.

Uses a 18650 battery(just be careful in cold weather)

Both modes are easy to use, once you read the instructions.

Eco is great for navigating the house at night.

Turbo is incredibly bright and effective.

Beam width and throw are so good, you’ll forget you can’t zoom it.

Seems to be a good value.

Cons:

359,R1H4W4N4W68943,True,Sucks battery power too fast plus their customer service isn't good.,"I can’t recommend this light anymore. First off the light is faulty. I’ve had mine for about 2 years. Rarely used it until switching to night shift a few months ago and even then I only use it for short periods of time a few nights a week. I’ve had to replace the battery 3 times in 4 months. This thing drains batteries so fast. I don’t even use it on the highest brightness. Which on that topic, my light gets very hot on the highest level. Not sure if mine is defective or what. Again, it’s barely gotten any use.

Second issue is these guys have really slow/poor customer service. I've left them 2 voice messages in 2 weeks and not yet received a return call. Their chat feature is always off line too. This isn't because of Covid either. I had another Fenix Lighting product I had to contact them about maybe 4 years ago now and it was the same dance.

I very much appreciate the strobe mode, very good for self-defense as whoever is attacking will not be able to see or identify you and will disorient them. I had my brother strobe me to see the effect, good luck being able to see or think clearly for a while haha.

Completely worth the money I payed for it, I was skeptical as the most expensive flashlight I purchased before this was $10 and was okay, I figured at about 6 times the price, I would get at least 6 times the luminosity. Oh boy was I mistaken, I got closer to 100 times more light. 1,000 lumens is no joke, holding the light near your skin on turbo mode will begin to get hot and burn, gotta love a powerful tool.

I chose this one for the tactical features and carry clip, I love the carry clip, which also rotates 360 degrees. The build quality is outstanding, nothing about this looks or feels cheap.

I liked the light so much that I immediately bought another one to replace it and knowing that Fenix had a warranty I sent their customer service an email and told them that I dropped it and broke it. They asked if the head or the switch was the defective part to which I told them the head and they immediately volunteered to send me a replacement head.

I still have it, to this very day. Fast forward to today, I am currently employed in the industrial field, mainly taking part in shut-downs and turn-arounds, for various plants.
Although I had been using my original Fenix light, in the beginning, I was a bit fearful of losing it, due to a sentimental attachment.
Therefore, I had purchased this one.
My immediate response was WOW! I LOVE THIS LIGHT! Not only is it powerful. It is reliable. While doing some hydroblast work, this light remained on and remained bright the whole time. And one of my favorite features, it uses the very same rechargeable batteries that I use in my Vape.

379,RLG2UMRLNSKCU,True,Overkill... and I like it.,"A reminder: battery not included.

This a spotlight masquerading as a flashlight. It is incredibly bright and definitely capable of projecting its light an incredibly far distance. I do not use it at its brightest setting, but it is nice to know you have it available. I would say this is definitely a luxury buy, as the light is definitely overkill for home use unless you live on an acre, or more, of property where animal visitors frequently like to visit. As always, your battery life will depend on frequency of use and your preferred brightness. On the scale of portable nightlight (1) to helicopter spotlight (5), I have it on 2 or 3 most of the time, which yields a longer battery life without sacrificing visibility. It a a quality torch.

The controls are a bit strange, as the power is on the tail, but is also used to switch to strobe.

Had some scrapes and a couple of nicks but it still works just fine. Seriously, 5 years old, or thereabout and even the Fenix battery still works. The PD35 does get a bit hot when in use for a long time, I was worried about this when it was new, thinking it was going to melt or fry out or something but after 5 years Im no longer concerned.

I just happen to really like the long throw beam aspect of the mini maglite which is the only reason for the four stars as this flashlight is superior in every other respect as it should be for the price.

Beside it, the ""headlamp"" style flashlights I have been using are a joke -- the Fenix brightens an area at least four times deeper. Took it camping in the Allagash last week and absolutely illuminated the campsite from inside the tent. And, if used defensively, this flashlight is easily bright enough to blind an attacker. It has five different levels of brightness, along with a ""strobe"" mode, which blinks the light rapidly on and off at varying rates -- great for signaling or disorienting an attacker. The brightest level is daylight-bright, it's really amazing. The flashlight is powered by one rechargeable specialty battery, expensive but long-lived. The unit is solidly built of sturdy aluminum and has a real heft to it compared to the typical plastic-case lights. I have dropped it a couple of times without issue and I expect it will outlive me. This is in fact an expensive flashlight if all you need is something to keep in the drawer if the power goes out -- but if you really want to light up the night with a solidly-built defensive weapon (honestly, it's tough enough to use as a club although you'd do better it holding it away from an attacker and shining it in the eyes), I don't see how you can do better than this.",the united states,"July 9, 2016",Maestro,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:11:16.564785,2020-11-12 11:11:16.685463,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

441,R1KPMLKVSHM88J,True,Quality EDC/home defense flashlight,"I use this light every day as my go to edc light and for scanning the back yard when I let the dog out at night.

The lumens level is great, and I enjoy the variety of power settings. Even though I've used this every day for the last six months or so, I've only replaced the batteries once. Obviously I don't blast on high lumens unless I need it.

The light does a great job for what it does, lighting stuff up! In addition to the lumens settings you can also soft press the button to turn the flashlight on, great if you're looking to avoid a full press of the button or want to pop a quick flash of light out. Home defense people should like this feature, which can be hard to find on similar lights.

This Fenix model is a bit thick to be using as an edc in your pants pocket, so you might want to consider using the belt attachment that comes with it instead, or keep it in a coat pocket. It fits fine in my pants, but it does bulge a bit, unlike say a stream light pen light.

The one thing that stops me from giving this flashlight five stars is the issue I have getting it to work every time new batteries go in it. I'm not stupid, I know how battery direction works- but when I put new batteries in the flashlight it will refuse to turn on. I'll need to readjust them or put them in a couple of times until the connection gets completed, and then I don't have an issue. When I first got the light and struggled with this issue I thought it was defective and was planning on returning it, but after some tinkering with the batteries for five or so minutes I got it to work. The same issue occurred when I replaced the batteries months later. I used stream light batteries in the size needed, next time I'll try a different brand. Either way its either a connection issue battery to battery, or battery to light.

I'll update my review when I try new batteries, and if it is a battery brand issue I'll move the rating to five stars.

Overall, the Fenix FX-PD35 is a quality built light for a good price with great features. Expect to have this light on you for years.

444,R6DGF0139H3D8,True,Hands Down the Best in the Business,"I own two PD35-TAC's and two PD35's. This is hands down my go-to flashlight. I currently have a PD-35 TAC on my rifle and one on my belt. I swapped the TAC for the regular PD on my rifle and it's worked wonders. The other PD my wife carries. Is it worth switching up to the TAC vs the price? No, not really. The extra couple lumens you wont notice. But if you're just going into the PD series for the first time, go big or go home (go for the TAC).

How do these perform? I'd prefer a little more of a focused beam as this has a bit of flood. When mounted on my rifle (and I'll put up an image of it mounted later), I get a significant amount of the light showing the barrel of my rifle. But handheld, it's solid for clearing rooms, searching yards, etc.

Before the PD series I came from the Fenix TK-40. Which if you've ever held one, is a BEAST of a flashlight. No way near capable of being mounted, terrible in the hand (unless you wanted to club someone) and chews through AA's like a monster. Going to this light is ridiculous in comparison. Not to mention a bump of almost 800 lumens.

456,RNL69CWCKPJJE,True,Great strong flashlight with a small but,"A bit pricy but a very good quality flashlight (cost me $110 including the li-ion batteries and a digital charger). We used this light in our recent holidays and lots of night photography sessions, I was really amazed with the quality and strength of the flash light when I was casting the light to a far away hill (only it causes blue hue in the atmosphere in between in the photos due to distance, but the hill has got exposed which was about 1 km away). The modes are very useful: I easily switched to lowest mode when I used it in tight spaces (such as looking for stuff in car boot), the strong mode would be blinding for that purpose. We did a fair bit of cave exploration, my partner tipped over at one of rocky waterlogged passages and submerged under water, she was worried the flashlight would get water in, we continued to submerge the flash afterwards for fun of it, I checked after coming out (and drying the outer housing) there was no sign of dampness inside, so it is really waterproof. It is excellent for outdoors, caving and camping.
However, I would like to share my experience with this light for photography use. I bought this light mainly for light painting and my night photography use. It is really strong and casts light to far away distance, but there is a little issue when you want to direct light for your target that I think you need to be aware of if you are also buying it for photography use. The light casts a strong central spot which is quite strong and lights up your far away subject, but it also casts I few stops dimmer light around that bright spot. This causes issues in long exposures: you can't control to expose only where you want, the area around your subject also will expose. I was trying to expose a tree at the beach without exposing the sand and passage going to the beach, but wasn't able to because the halo light made the sand also to appear in the photos. I still like this flashlight a lot, happy I bought it, and looking forward to use it more outdoors as well as photography.

474,R1XHUFDKDITP57,True,In My Opinion: Maybe For The 'Tactical' Types...,"In my opinion:

Have had and used this light off & on for a while now.

Never had a need for other than it's lowest two settings, and even then it's consumption of pricy 123A batteries seems high. It's nice knowing the higher modes are available, but in my case really never expect need for them; and especially never foresee need or use of the products embarrassing/gimmicky 'disco' (or however marketed) flash mode.

Light is also a little large to be carried clipped in jean front pockets... it can be done but is annoying. In normal use, the side selector button gets inadvertently pressed on occasion... invariably at inconvenient times. Said side button can be difficult/awkward to find by feel in the dark; notably when wearing gloves. The lights lack of 'tail stand' ability is another issue.

Product is beautifully constructed... CNC and anodize work is exquisite. Suspect it mostly consists of some variety of 6061. Light output is a bit on the cool side and displays no detectable PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) strobing.

This light probably meets needs of the 'tactical' crowd it's marketed to... and/or a source of mirth & merriment for 'tree spotter' types. However, for a technician who requires an unobtrusive easy to carry every day pocket light, I found it to be a 'useable', but suboptimal selection.

I purchased a second one of these lights as a gift for a colleague who initially showed interest in mine... however I suspect he later reached similar conclusions as I seldom see him with it anymore.

Review posted 7/16/2017 and will be updated should experience warrant.

Again, just my opinion.

481,R3CBGLWPWKN9JF,True,Almost Perfect....just a couple personal nit picks.,"I would give this 4.5 stars. The light is well made, uses the Cree LED and has off, low, medium, high, turbo (timed), and strobe capabilities. There is a momentary ON/OFF by lightly depressing the tail switch. There is also a button type switch on the body that allows you to cycle through the lights. Holding it down activates the strobe function. Beam spread is great, with a very bright, defined center and a less intense, ambient light circle. I find this arrangement most useful.
Why did I deduct a star (should really just be 1/2 a star)? The light includes a Cordura belt case, extra O-rings, a lanyard and a pocket clip, but no battery. I need a battery, the other items are great, but not required to make the light work. Fenix documentation recommends their own 18650 battery, but makes it appear others should not be used. I would stay away from the counterfeit, cheap batteries, but Panasonic or the branded Panasonic's by Orbtronics 3400 Ah and a few others, are outstanding for use in these lights.
The light itself is excellent, and appears well made. I'm pleased there is a remote switch available for use on a tactical shotgun. I do not like the wire coil that may snag or having to tape up the excess wire. I know there are applications for this type cord, but I want the ability to customize the fit, so I don't have a possible hazard hanging off my weapon. Moving with the muzzle pointed down, then raising the weapon at a target, and getting the wire caught on dresser or cabinet knob is a real possibility I prefer to avoid. These are nits, and personal taste.

It stays at the level last used which is usually good for me but if I needed or wanted the highest setting I would then have to cycle the side button until I got to the setting I wanted. And at the highest setting it gets hot really fast so unless you needed to blind someone then you will most likely dim it down for normal use. I will note that it won't stand on it's tail as the push button on the back end protrudes far enough to prevent that but the flats on the bezel will allow you to lean it against something like a cabinet wall if working hands free. It's very compact especially for how bright it is and is easily carried on the belt. The case is rather flimsy but does it's job and I will most likely replace it someday with a heavier case. All in all, this light is very good for personal defense and extremely good for everyday use around the house.",the united states,"November 26, 2016",malaqua,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:13:00.454735,2020-11-12 11:13:00.584373,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

615,R396LUG5MWKQ2C,True,Why did I shine this stupid thing in my eye?,"I've been getting PD-series Fenix lights every few years. Their performance has grown exponentially and is comparable to Surefire at easily half the price.

These lights are tough, light, compact, and powerful. Not sure if it's a true 1000-lumen but it really doesn't matter because unless you're using it as a substitute for headlights while driving at highway speeds on a cloudy night a hundred miles from the nearest town, you're not going to have a problem seeing ahead of you. By the way, pictures of this light's performance at night don't do it any justice. I've used it to light up treetops 200 yards away, and of course made the mistake of shining it into my retina to check its tactical capacity. I figure it's strong enough to blind/disorient and ruin your night vision at 40 feet +, so it's definitely rifle-ready. There are stronger lights out there but for the price, it's the way to go.

The belt holster for this model is not as good as it was a few years ago, the light doesn't sit deep enough in it, so you may need a custom fit. Same thing with the belt clip - sticks out of the pocket too far in my opinion. If you want to never think about your battery life, set to medium and run it off the Panasonic 3400mah Japanese made 18650s (the green ones), best battery for the $ at the time of this writing.

The outdoor mode is great because you can switch between brightness settings almost instantly. I will have it set to 500 lumens for some shooting and then I can switch it to a lower setting while examining targets and reloading so I don't burn through the ridiculously expensive batteries.

It's sturdy, bright (almost too bright!), and light enough to not even notice on your belt, clipped into a pocket, or carried in a pack.

I purchased this light with the 3400 mAh Orbtronic batteries. Although I have yet to actually time the lifespan in all its modes, it absolutely maintains its light output all the way down to a dead battery. That being said, and noting that I rarely ever use this flashlight on max output (low or medium usually provides enough light for my purposed) I've found that the batteries will more than last for a work week without having to change the batteries (under moderate use).

Although at its price point it may be off-putting to some, keep in mind you're getting ten times the flashlight you're going to find at WalMart or the hardware store.

717,R13D4Z25Y0W8Q9,True,"Decent value, poor tail cap","This is a decent flashlight in the $60-70 range.

Someone said he/she would happily pay $150 for this light, that is ridiculous. I don't know why this person would say such a ridiculous thing, but it was said. I would suggest you disregard the review in question. In the range of $150 I'd buy an Elzetta. I don't want to spend that much on a flashlight though so I bought this.

My chief complaint is the tail cap. It's very easy to click, even when you don't mean to. At some point in my day I wonder why is my pocket so hot, then I remember the flashlight and take it out incredibly hot and turn it off. This happens at least once a day. I carry it in my left front pocket, because that's where I have space, and at some point during my day I bend over, or sit down and accidentally click the tail cap.

I bought this to be an ECD light, but it sucks for that. It will live out its life as my nightstand light. For ECD I'm going back to a light that uses a notary cap for constant on function.

For the money, and by that I mean no more than $70 this isn't a horrible light, it just isn't right for me.",the united states,"June 6, 2018",Dick Danger,3.0,0,2020-11-12 11:14:10.786458,2020-11-12 11:14:10.962980,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

737,R29N09EN0WHX6I,True,A Beautiful Little Flashlight,"Great little flashlight, but it doesn't need 5 modes. This is certainly a minor nit, but it is difficult to see the difference between ""High"" and ""Turbo"" modes (500 and 1,000 lumens, respectively) and given the extra heat buildup and reduced battery life of the Turbo mode, I never use it. The ""Eco"" mode (8 lumens) is not really useful except perhaps in a true survival situation (runtime: 140hours). I would have been happy with three modes, Low, Medium and High.

Construction seems excellent, well finished and is a joy to hold in the hand. On/Off switch has a nice positive (waterproof) feel with a momentary function, the mode switch seems a little less positive, but I don't use the mode switch often. I purchased the ARC-1 charger and two ARB-L2 batteries (18650, 3200mAh) to go with this light from the Fenix web site. They also carry a flashlight mount to fix the light to a Picatinny/Weaver rail system and a remote On/Off switch.",the united states,"March 14, 2016",Bill Hunter,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:14:21.962968,2020-11-12 11:14:22.090382,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

800,R99I45ECFG47T,True,Love it.,"I really like this light. The size is good. The throw is more than I need. And the tactical feature is the best because I don't have to worry about putting it back on high if I had it on low when I need it immediately.

The only thing with smaller lights is you get a lot less candela as opposed to my stinger hl which I love. It's half the lumens but twice the candela making it more efficient and throw farther. I like that hot spot but I don't really needed it and wanted something smaller to carry.

The lumens are very high though. I must have accidentally sat on it turning it on. I smelled something burning. It was the light getting hot. Wasn't the light burning but because it was enclosed.

827,R6CL6BE4BVP8F,True,Amazing! The best flashlight ever!,"This is by far the BEST flashlight we have every owned. Bought one for my husband after I discovered how amazing this flashlight performs. We have a Extremely bright light that will illuminate items even in bright sunlight. While at the beach, from the 14th fIoor in our condo, I beamed the light down to the ocean, shore & dunes. It was like I had a mini-lighthouse in my hand. It was so powerful, I could see every ripple in the sand! It is extremely lightweight & comes with a sturdy carrying case with a velcro closure. There is a convenient sturdy round woven strap that can be looped at the end of the flashlight for safety when in operation and when carrying the light. The strap sticks out of the top of the case making it easy to handle & locate. The charge lasts for weeks, even with daily use. I carry mine in my purse & it has come in handy so many times. We own a marine grade 1000 lumen rechargeable flashlight that is extremely heavy & hard to use. The Fenix outperforms the marine light & is so much easier to use! When you really are serious about finally purchasing a GREAT flashlight that will exceed your expections, buy the Fenix.

My favorite feature is being able to turn the light on and off at the pre-selected brightness level. I had a streamlight before and it always came on at the brightest level. You had to press and hold the tail-button for several seconds to get the desired brightness level (annoying when you are turning the light on and off repeatedly, also wears out the tail button). The Fenix PD35 is well built, has a handy pocket clip (removable), and is incredibly bright. Often I find the brightest setting too bright for up-close work, so the lower settings options are great.

916,RREBU2AZDOLF0,True,I've been running it primarily on panasonic 18650 cells and the control circuit has had not a single problem running from ultra,"Having the light for the past two weeks, I can say it's held up fairly well considering it was pressed immediately into service. I've been running it primarily on panasonic 18650 cells and the control circuit has had not a single problem running from ultra low to stupid bright. No sign of PWM, so the lamp is current controlled as advertised.

Throw seems pretty solid too. Fairly tighter and a bit farther than the 4-7s MMX on the workbench (XM-L G2). Machining work is great, the lens is AR coated, and all the threads are fairly coarse and flat topped to stave off cross threading. Large, single orings seal the body ends. Time will tell how well the button system holds up compared to something very mechanical like the MMXs sliding contacts.

The Fenix doesn't capture the battery like the MMX, so I wouldn't expect this light to last as long mounted onto a rifle. A battery slamming back and forth won't be nice to a PCB.
I'll have to test on an AR at some point. (Which is another caveat, this light is thinner than 1"", so beware thinking you'll use just any light mount).

For a solid, general purpose light, the Fenix so far hits an excellent price/performance spot. Just be careful, this light is surprisingly small, and therefore could easily find its way out of a pocket. For now, the PD35 usurps my trusty MMX for daily carry.",the united states,"August 13, 2016",Mike D,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:16:00.489540,2020-11-12 11:16:00.612221,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

922,R2EUEL0Q2009PW,True,Does not work with CR123A batteries,"I purchased a Fenix PD35 Tactical light a week ago and some 18650, 3400 mAh batteries and a charger. Charged the battery and tried the light. It worked great. It is advertised to work with either 1: 18650 or 2: CR123A batteries. I put some CR123A batteries in it and it did not work. If I held in the tailpiece switch, it would come on, but would not stay on. I know the CR123A batteries were installed with the correct polarity. I have contacted Fenix customer service, but have not heard back from them yet. Don't know if this is a faulty unit or a product wide problem.. If this is resolved due to a faulty unit, I will revise my review. I think I will like the light and the features. The 18650 batteries are a snug fit (don't know if that is due to the brand I'm using ( Keeppower 3400 ma\Ah) or that is the case with all protected 18650 batteries. To remove them, I have to remove the light head and the tail piece and push it out enough to grip the negative end of the battery and pull it out.

I had read online on one of the forums, that people have had trouble with the plate that holds the tailpiece switch in place getting loose. I tighten it and the light worked again with 18650. It still did not work with CR123A batteries.

It has been one week since I ordered this light and I have actually had it less than a week. It is supposed to work on two CR123A batteries.

Please send me a light that works with either (1) 18650 or (2) CR123A batteries as advertised.",the united states,"March 26, 2017",John W,2.0,0,2020-11-12 11:16:03.513551,2020-11-12 11:16:03.638423,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

943,R10MXXQ7NLFI9S,True,"Tolle Lampe, aber missliche Bedienung im TacModus","Ich habe diverse Fenixlampen.

Ich nutze sie beruflich. Ich habe mich sehr gefreut, dass Fenix endlich meine E-Mail-Vorschläge umgesetzt hat.

Also sofort bestellt:

Dann LEIDER: Im TAC-Modus, startet die Lampe im hellsten Modus. Soweit so gut. Will man dann in den LOW-Modus schalten, wird die Lampe zum Überraschungsei!
Anstatt die Modi weiterhin über den seitlichen Schalter auszuwählen, muss man hinten antippen: nur ganz leicht, und dann das Ding durchdrücken, was man will. Die Reihenfolge war wie folgt: Hight, Strope low, ultra-low.

Ich habe mich sehr über die Lampe gefreut, da durch die beiden Grund-Modi alle Wünsche erfüllt werden. Aber im Tac-Modus auf low zu schalten mit dieser super bescheuerten Steuuerung geht garnicht.

So nutze ich im Dienst weiter die alter pd35 als Sekundär und die Klarus XT 11 als Primärlampe",germany,"July 27, 2015",m4c2,1.0,0,2020-11-12 11:16:17.641713,2020-11-12 11:16:17.770990,"Fenix Flashlights FX-PD35TAC Flashlight, 1000 Lumen, Black",4.5,108.53,,Tools & Home Improvement,B010ESCLHW,,"#39,149 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
