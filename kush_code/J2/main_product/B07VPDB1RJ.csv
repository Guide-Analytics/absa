 It feels like I have a little piece of sun shine in my pocket. This is the best option available in its size.

1,R2EO9L844MCJGS,True,Excellent flashlight; batteries don't fit in box,"Excellent flashlight, with the quality level I've come to expect from Fenix. Impressive brightness for it's size -- but do keep in mind that it cannot sustain maximum brightness continuously, it will gradually decrease (this is well documented).

2,R3B6YB0XD8B9D1,True,Great flashlight,"I took a star away because the supplied battery case can’t hold the rechargeable batteries that came with this flashlight. Definitely useless, not a deal breaker though.

I have owned the older fenix (pd35 I think) since 2010/2011 and it’s still going strong. I ordered this for the extra brightness and rechargeable batteries.

From what I understand the batteries aren’t the standard size according to some reviews. So I ordered this (x2 battery) set with the assumption these will be the only batteries I will use until they fail.

So far it’s an excellent flashlight, no issues and seems of similar quality to my older fenix flashlight (which has withstood harsh environments and abuse). I’m hoping this will last years to come as well.

—Very bright for the size
—Seems very well built
—Very useful eco mode for extended use
—Upside USB-C charging
-Downside charging one battery at a time w/flashlight. Doesn’t come w/extra charger.
—Very easy/simple to use

-Will update if needed.",the united states,"March 18, 2020",John,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:38:46.884942,2020-11-12 11:38:47.010606,"Fenix PD36R 1600 Lumen Rechargeable Tactical Flashlight, Additional 5000 mAh Battery bundle",4.7,172.95,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07VPDB1RJ,,"#105,502 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3,R285K61FPYD7KT,True,Too many problems with this light,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The first one I order worked fine, but only for a short while. After a few months of light use, the constant-on function would no longer work, it was stuck in momentary only. I paid for shipping and sent it back under warranty. The replacement light I received was even worse than the original. The light would constantly flicker on and off, and often times would not switch through light modes, even after trying 3 different fully charged batteries. Customer service with EdisonBright tells me “ It is highly unusual to have such problem in two lights,” and they don’t seem to want to replace the second faulty light sent to me.

4,R23VVVZEUQJ954,True,Almost perfection,Excellent flashlight! I now use this as my patrol duty flashlight. It is extremely bright and has both good throw and good spill. In turbo mode it lights everything up bright. I like it so much I ordered a second to keep in my personal vehicle or for edc. I subtracted 1 point only because if you shut it off in a lower power mode and then turn it on again it reverts back to that lower position.

6,R188V82ZNEPCGJ,True,Great Flashlight,"I use this thing daily at work. I use the 30 lumen eco for the majority of things but switch to high when I need to inspect seriously. I rarely use the turbo mode but it works really well. The battery lasts me ages like this. I don't even use the secondary battery. If you were using this continuously in high mode, then the second battery might be useful. I could see that situation in absolute darkness in the woods or something like that. I bought this and the ThruNite TC15 and I prefer the Fenix PD36R by far. The ThruNite is too small and that almost makes it awkward at work. If I was camping, the TC15 would be better because it's so portable with a lot of power. The lumen range works perfect for me on the Fenix. The back button is so much better and I never accidentally turn it on. The TC15 on a belt in my work would come on all the time. The TC15 requires you to hold to toggle modes. I don't like that, I prefer the Fenix where there are two buttons, one controls mode and the other is on/off.

7,R3B7AIUW9S9U86,True,Amazing piece of engineering packed into this beautiful sturdy aluminum housing.,"I only give the battery life a 4 star because I have yet to rate it based on purchase date,to include the fact I owned a PD35 that runs off the 18650 Batteries and one the cell pretty much failed after about 8 - 10 charging cycles. However this New PD36R is like the perfect light, throwed settings is ideal for most applications like inspections etc. being I'm a mechanic. Then the ability to increase the brightness with the press of a button is awesome.. it's beam extends beyond what I even expected and covers a pretty wide area also. One of the best things about it also is that you can leave the batter in the light housing and charge it via Type-C usb, no need for external chargers unless you plan on having backup batteries in sets readily available. Just be a little cautious as, when on Max output the top part of the housing tends to get a little warmer than usua almost hot, nonetheless the lens remain intact abd true.

10,R3PYKDCQH2JUYS,True,Incredibly bright and well made.,"This thing is BRIGHT. I like the new battery style, the light isn't in anyway noticeably larger than other models. It's pretty low profile but the output is clearly noticeable.

The only downside is the battery life on higher settings is a bit lower than what they imply. There is a notice on the turbo setting that it includes when it automatically lowers the output if the battery gets too low so I'm not really sure how much time you actually get from it. I usually use on the high if I'll be using for an extended time.
