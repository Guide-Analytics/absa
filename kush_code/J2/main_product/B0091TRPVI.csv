1,RFTVX74LQEMOW,True,"Wow, Fenix E25 is a winner!","I did a lot of research before purchasing Fenix E25 flashlights as gifts for several family members. These lights are amazing. Compared to similar lights in this class and size that I have seen, the Fenix seems to be brighter and the beam carries much farther. I was able to easily cast a bright spotlight on a playground structure ~ 100 yards away, for example, even with considerable ambient light also in the area. Compared side by side with a similarly priced and featured flashlight, the TerraLUX LighStar300, the Fenix E25 had a noticeably brighter, more concentrated beam, and was also quite a bit smaller. I won't say it put out more light in total volume, because the TerraLUX beam was much more dispersed and lit up a wider area up close, but the Fenix E25 was definitely more impressive and the beam carried at least twice as far as that on the LightStar300.

The build quality of the E25 is impressive, the three different brightness settings are very useful, and this flashlight is SMALL! I was surprised how small the E25 is and that might be it's best feature of all, this would fit so easily in any backpack or pocket, and it runs on two AA batteries so it is easy and cheap to carry backups batteries with you if you are hiking or camping for example.

Very impressed, couldn't recommend this flashlight more.",the united states,"January 24, 2013",Josef K,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:33:18.648975,2020-11-12 11:33:18.795095,Fenix E25 Flashlight-187 Lumens,3.9,118.45,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0091TRPVI,,"#709,662 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2,R29JQN1SN6ME4Y,True,Almost Perfect,"I loved the very long throw of this light, but it's case is a little long for my use, and I wanted the lighter weight and higher power density of a LION battery, so bought the E35. Unfortunately, the E35 has a BAD doughnut hole artifact that leaves what you're pointing it at in the dark.

Bottom line, I'm probably going to keep the E25 and return the E35. They're both good lights though, so I hate to return either of them, but of the two, this one has a MUCH better beam pattern, and I can't say I notice the few meters of advertised throw I give up with the E25.

I guess I'll just have to buy some high-end AA NiMh cells, and put up with the extra weight on my bicycle helmet. The issue there is neck strain on long rides.

If you haven't used a Fenix light, and want one with a very tight beam, you're in for a real treat with this light. For reference, IIRC, a 6 D-Cell MagLite with a Xeon bulb is about 80 lumens. You can get that much light out of an LD01, powered by a single AAA cell. I have one, and 3 other Fenix lights.

3,R30STDSQKIY079,True,Awesome bright,"Pros: Brighter than previous L2D Fenix flashlight and has more crisp light edges. Has different brightness settings which helps when hunting and not wanting to ""over shine"" your light and allows your batteries last a longer on lower settings. Quite, easy and seamless function. Fits in older head mount clamp. Works on 2 Enelope AA batteries just fine. Lightweight cool design. More simple than previous Fenix designs which allows for less malfunction. Cheaper than previous Fenix lights as well. Would definitely recommend.

Cons: I like the switch better than the rear button switch although I can see the light accidentally turning on easier than other lights cause of the ease at pushing the soft button switch and it's location on the side. Especially if you keep it in your pocket and bend over putting pressure on the switch. No options for remote on/off switch and location/type of switch does not lend itself easily for use mounted on a firearm or bow. This isn't what the light was meant for as every flashlight maker has their ""tactical"" line but usually the tactical versions run twice the cost. If this light had either a remote switch or it's switch was in a different location and not delayed it could easily be used as a tactical light. But because of the switch it really isn't ideal for that at all.

4,R36G0SA6W6RLKN,True,Great utility light,"I was looking for another flashlight, and had three requirements: handily small, runs on AAs, and is bright enough to make you notice. This hits two out of three.

The good points:
* Runs on two AAs. Lithium cells are great in flashlights, but expensive and disposable unless you have a lithium ion battery charger, which most people don't. 1 AA cell lights can be pretty small, but don't get bright enough or don't last long enough.
* Regulated. This means the brightness stays constant until the batteries get low, at which point you get the dim setting, and then nothing.
* Bright. I thought it was plenty bright when I first turned it on, then found the high setting. You don't want to look into it.
* Good beam color, good ""throw"", only a little dimmed circle in the center of the spot.
* Good build quality. Solid, not heavy. Can ""tail stand"" if you don't use the lanyard and that kind of thing is important to you.

The so-so points. These aren't necessarily bad, just things to note:
* Bigger than single AA or CR123A lights. Not as comfortably pocketable.
* User interface isn't immediately obvious. You need to long press to turn it on and off, short press to toggle modes; if you don't know this, you will be wondering why it isn't working. Thus, no ""instant on"" capability.

A lot of the people looking for those two things are probably looking for an ""EDC"" light, maybe for possible personal defense use, and were drawn to this light because of the manufacturer (Fenix *Tactical*), a well known tactical light brand. This particular light is not ideal for that, but as a flashlight for the house or car, it is excellent.

Maglite makes a comparable flashlight, the Mini Maglite Pro (http://www.amazon.com/Maglite-SP2P01H-2Cell-Flashlight-Black/dp/B005UUSAAM), that you might also consider. Regulated, brighter (226 lumens) and cheaper, but less throw.

5,R7AOAY11PVCLS,True,Good Flashlight,"I bought this flashlight to replace my 100 lumens work flashlight. I very much like the 27, 90, and 187 lumens light intensity, One good thing is I like the intelligent memory that goes back to the last lumens light setting. It took me awhile to get use to holding the ""on"" button for a few seconds to turn on the light.

This light is really easy to fit in my back pocket compared to the old work light and very light. Overall I like the size an weight of the light.

The light beam is uniform with a center that fades out as it spreads out to give it a nice wide light that is focused.

I like the fact this flashlight uses AA batteries that is affordable compared to the 123 batteries. I routinely use a light and the AA batteries are affordable and easy to find if it need them.

6,R35VGI9ZXK7200,True,Great value for an emergency light,"I give Fenix lights as presents and therefore have 2 in our house, and have seen 4 other models. This one is a nice light for general use in that it is very bright, and the switch is on the side which anybody who doesn't want a tactical light might prefer. That said, for a general use, non-tactical flashlight, it's a bit beamy. The center dot is super bright and apparent, but it isn't floody. You'd think that brighter would always be better, but unless you are trying to pick out details at 150 feet, a floodier beam would be better in my opinion, which is why I prefer the LD20's beam spread. The center on the LD20 isn't as bright when both lights are maxed, but the useful light is nicer.

7,R152QH7AKVVJR9,True,Packs a Lot of Punch,"I knew when I decided to purchase this particular flashlight it is a fairly small unit, so I wasn't at all disappointed by its diminutive size. That being said I appreciate the heft of it. It feels substantial even though it's small enough to fit easily into a back pocket. Which brings me to my only complaint. I use the light at work quite a lot. My mobile phone occupies the thigh pocket of my cargo pants and rather than jam the light in with the phone and risk scratching the screen or worse I keep the light in my back pocket. I do quite a bit of walking around the plant and hardly notice it, but it's easily accessible when I do need it. The problem occurs when I sit down. The power button is raised and the pressure from either the pocket material or my glutes (when the light is oriented just right) is enough to close the switch for the 2 seconds it takes to turn the light on. Sadly I don't even realize this happens until I feel the heat from the light on my butt assuming I'm still sitting. If I'm walking again the pocket is loose enough I don't notice 'til I pull the light out to use it. And I can tell you the light gets very warm when its insulated even that little bit.

Just an observation, not a complaint, I started out using rechargeable AA batteries fresh off the charger and couldn't get the light to cycle through all three brightness levels (which are very distinct btw). I thought the blasted thing was broken straight out of the package and was very irritated considering the rave reviews. I switched out the rechargeables for a set of brand new Duracells, lo'n'behold it cycled without a hitch. I'm not sure if my NiMH batts were guilty for being a little older and not producing enough voltage or what, but a fresh set from the store fully charged did the trick. I was hoping the issue was not with rechargeables altogether because Fenix' manual even states rechargeables are the batts of choice. So have no fear, just keep them fresh.

I think enough has been said about the brightness of this little devil. It is incredible just how much light the thing can throw. Hands down one of the best flashlights I've ever used. It's tough, dependable, and aesthetically pleasing as a flashlight can be I suppose. And for the <$50 price tag it's worth every single penny. Good job, Fenix!

8,R30YEFZAIJTOJX,True,"Nice light, but not as good as the LD12","This is a decent light that I keep in my desk drawer at work. For the price, it's a nice light. But, it's a bit too big for everyday carry. Won't fit in the breast pocket of my coat. Also, it doesn't have a tail switch. I also own a couple of Fenix LD12 lights, and would recommend them over this one, even though they cost more. The LD12 also uses AA, and seems brighter, has a tail switch along with the mode switch, and is lighter and easier to carry. I own dozens of different lights from different manufacturers, and this one gets a solid 8 of 10. It's comparable to price of an LED Lenzer in the same brightness, but it's smaller than the Lenzer.

9,R3GPDDQJDW8KHH,True,Glove Box Light,"Pros:
o Pretty beam--better than my Malkoff M60, with seemingly identical, bright white tint
o Good UI--3 modes that range from moderate (25 hrs) to blinding (2 hrs), in that order
o Versatile--tailstand capable, comfortable feel in hand, waterproof

Cons:
o Not multi-cell capable

Other Thoughts:
This is a solid torch that works for a variety of environments and costs less than a full tank of unleaded. To my eye, the beam is every bit as bright as my trusty Malkoff M60 on 2 lithium primaries. No, it probably won't withstand extended weapon recoil (the switch design wouldn't be appropriate for this use anyway). But then again it only cost 1/4th the price of lights that would. Giving this light an inner diameter that allows for use of 3 lithium primary cells would be icing on the cake. 5 Stars.",the united states,"March 2, 2013",C.

The 187 setting is super bright and very useful outside at night.

15,R2CRN11LB0OCHF,True,Great choice in an emergency.,"I picked up this flashlight after Hurricane Sandy. My old AA LED flashlight had died on me. The reason I chose this one is because of how good it would have been to have it when the power was out.

Fenix lights are some of the best flashlights you can buy. I used to worry about how bright LED flashlights were, but these days, most of the good brand names make lights that are far brighter than you'll ever need. They're much brighter than the old incandescent flashlights ever were. This one is no exception, but that's not why it stands out.

It stands out because of its battery life, but not because it's the longest out there. A lot of lights have a low setting that lasts longer, but few are this bright on low. Stand it on its end, and point it at the ceiling when the lights are out. It's bright enough to use in place of a lantern, to read by or do other things. You'll get over 20 hours of good, usable light out of 2 AA batteries. Most of the lights that can run longer on a pair of AAs won't give you enough light to read by.

When the storm hit, there were few or no C or D cells on the shelves. There were plenty of AAs. They're cheaper, lighter, and you probably already have them when you need them. This flashlight is slim and light. It's easy to carry around so it's there when you need it.",the united states,"November 12, 2012",Josh,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:33:26.926009,2020-11-12 11:33:27.055787,Fenix E25 Flashlight-187 Lumens,3.9,118.45,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0091TRPVI,,"#709,662 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

16,R1OUWA80MCLF7X,True,Power button needs work,"Pros:

-This flashlight is very bright. I definitely trust the 187 lumen rating. In fact, I have not seen a brighter flashlight that uses standard AA batteries.
-It has durable metal construction.
-Best of all, it uses common aa batteries unlike other lights which use expensive lithium batteries.
-Affordable
-Remembers previously used brightness setting.

Unfortunately, it's not perfect. It is still a very good light for the price, but you are probably better off with the Fenix E21. The E21 is very similar, but has a standard tailcap switch which I prefer to the button on this light.

Cons:

-The power switch is an electronic button mounted on the side of the flashlight. Hold for 1 second to turn on and off; tap to cycle between brightnesses. This is annoying because people do not expect you to have to hold down the button to turn it on. The button also is slightly flaky: occasionally you have to hold it down longer or press it a couple of times for the light to come on.

19,RQG8UW05YNDZB,True,Phenominal light - Dont let the size fool you!,"For the price (and size) this is an impressive light. I have been impressed by this brand in the year or so since I purchased the TK41 (an 8xAA battery powered light).
Size by side this light is brighter than the TK41 when both are set on low. It is also brighter in the middle setting than the second setting of the TK41 and about as bright as the third setting. On high the E25 is brighter than the second highest setting of the TK41 though think the TK41 has more throw. The TK41 is notably brighter on high. But I have to say this little light is impressive for the amount of light it generates. It is a very usable mix of spot and spread with 100+ yards good visibility in the woods. When you consider how pocketable and light this light is it really is impressive.
I like the switch - it works well and has a good feel. Hold down for 2 seconds to turn it on (on to the last setting). Quick depress to cycle through the three settings. Hold button to turn off.
The included lanyard is a little bulky considering how compact the light is.
So far it is by far a great buy in my opinion.

 Fenix E25 Review:

Pros:
- EXTREMELY bright
- 3 settings
- lifetime warranty!

Cons:
- to get extremely bright, you need rechargeable batteries.
- on highest setting, it will sometimes get very hot.
- The switch sometimes doesn't work so you have to click for a bit, doesn't happen often, but shouldn't matter since it's covered by warranty.
- not a lot of gun mounts will adapt to this, it's far too small.

Bottom-line: This is the OLDER version of it. I'm assuming the newer one is rated at lower lumens because it gets too hot. This little guy will run you the price of a few flashlights, but since it uses 2 batteries and it's relatively thin, it is worth it if you need a flashlight with a better grip than something tiny and you won't have to worry so much about damaging it (warranties for the win). If I had another $40, I would probably get 8 of the tiny flashlights though. I doubt that many of them could break before my Fenix!

Here is my Snap-On  Snap-on 92177 3D-Cell/2AA-Cell Aluminum Flashlight Combo Pack  review:

It's probably not right to compare to LED's, but seeing as how LED's are available and the end rubber ring broke off within minutes of using it, I felt that I needed to compare it to the modern available options.

The other flashlights in the video are as follows:
Fenix E25 Flashlight
FordEx Group 300lm Mini Cree Led Flashlight Torch Adjustable Focus Zoom Light Lamp

Pros:
- Yellow light
- You can use it for self-defense

Cons:
- Low output compared to LED's
- The highest focus is not as focused as LED's
- Rubber parts are just glued on, they come off easily

Bottom-line: Looking for a cheap flashlight? Get a tiny LED for $5. Looking for one that lasts? Get a lifetime warranty flashlight that has at the very least, twice the output of a cheap $5 LED. Only get this if you really need a large flashlight with warmer colors.",the united states,"May 7, 2013",D.

59,R2AEP6UOL9RTBK,True,Misleading Product Description and Frustrating to Use,"First of all I love the Fenix brand. I've purchased a very expensive Fenix 760 Lumen flashlight that is as bright as my car's headlights on bright, I've been using for two years and it's still going strong. The build quality is amazing and it's just a fantastic light.

This light, however, is kind of misleading. It says 260 Lumens, which is true, but only if you physically hold the on-button, and continue holding (aka continuing to apply pressure without letting go of the button). This is so annoying. Why not just let me turn it on and have 260 Lumens like a normal torch?

You do have this option, you know, turning the flashlight on by just pressing the button, but on the highest setting it is only 130 Lumens. And trust me, there's a huge difference. Oh, and even then you have to hold the button for a few moments before the light comes on, but you have to let go before it goes into ""burst"" mode (260 Lumens), or it just turns off again when you let go. There's an issue with timing that I don't want to have to think about when turning on a flashlight.

Also- I have absolutely no idea why the title of this product states that it is ""187 Lumens."" It isn't, not on any setting, so that's weird.

Basically, I want a light that turns on when I press on, and turns off when I press off, and is as bright as the brightest setting promises. This light, I was frustrated to discover, is not designed this way. Maybe if you're a security guard this is a good thing, who knows. For someone who just wants basic functionality I would recommend another Fenix torch.",the united states,"August 20, 2014",Hirum Horkweller,2.0,0,2020-11-12 11:33:47.353698,2020-11-12 11:33:47.483331,Fenix E25 Flashlight-187 Lumens,3.9,118.45,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0091TRPVI,,"#709,662 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

68,R2SDEVTPA0H9H1,True,Worked well until the batteries died and they became lodged inside.,"Flashlight is incredibly bright for its size. The reason for the low rating is because when it came time to replace the first set of batteries, they became impossible to take out.

As a matter of fact, they are still stuck inside no matter what I try to remove them.

After some research, it appears this is a common problem with these flashlights where the battery swells and gets stuck in the body.

What a waste of money. I strongly suggest you reconsider other flashlights as this issue will render your 40 dollar flashlight useless after the first set of batteries die and get stuck.

It can also be used for more general purposes. It can stand upright and a ceiling will spread the light around the environment, if you have a temporary blackout or so.

Ergonomics are simple, it fits well on the hand, and contrary to looks the flashlight would roll this is due to the on button that protrudes. The beam distance is truely impressive. Although the manufactures says 156 meters On my last camping trip I was able to messure the distance and it felt close to 200 meters on pitch black.
