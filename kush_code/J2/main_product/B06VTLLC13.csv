1,RDPSFGXDQKJUE,True,"Not a fake model, excellent EDC!","Not a fake, for those who are concerned about all the fake versions online, a fake has a waffle print button, black o-ring cap seal, silver color spring in the end cap. The real ones come with a ""streamlight"" brand CR-123,& ""Energizer"" brand AA next to the flashlight with a nylon pouch in the back, a ""S"" in the shield streamlight logo printed button, red o-ring, and gold colored spring on the end cap. These are the real deal😊 so feel confident in your purchase.

This is the most versatile flashlight in terms of battery options, that I know of, without needing any adapter. AAA, AA,(14500), CR123,(16340), there are probably other options that will work to be honest, but these are just what I tried so far... 16mm diameter (maybe16.8mm if you want exact maximum)×38mm, any longer will need be a smaller diameter 14mm ×57mm length are about the maximum dimensions that will fit the lower section. Basically the lower section is tapered a little smaller on the inside diameter, making the AA, AAA center nicely, but just the fact that I can use such a variety of rechargeable, or single use batteries makes this the perfect EDC, at least in my mind... the ""ten tap"" programming is excellent, I prefer the ""low"" setting, where I can 2 tap to get the ""high"" setting when needed.

This is my second ""streamlight"" my first was well used, dropped, submerged, lost & found a few times, and never failed me in 7 years of daily use (some weekends off). It was pretty scratched up, but worked without fail, in the end, unfortunately it was lost, and I had a few other cheaper ones that I used until now... This is a nice replacement, it's brighter, the ""ten tap"" is also a nice upgrade, and a better fit in my hand.",canada,"December 9, 2018",Uriah ,5.0,2,2020-10-27 22:26:59.705141,2020-10-27 22:26:59.821791,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2,R2AS45NXKIITUS,True,Get one!,"Finally a EDC flashlight I can use with either CR123A or AA batteries.

I'm ex military, and ever since Streamlight came out with the Sidewinder Compact II that used either CR123A or AA batteries, I'd been hoping they would do the same for an EDC size flashlight. I own several Streamlight products, either for work or outdoors activities they all were one battery type or another. Now I tend to always carry spares, but if you run out, some types are harder to find than others, ex: CR123A.

Now that they offer the ProTac 1L-1AA, it takes care of that problem. It runs on CR123A Lithium, AA Alkaline or AA Lithium batteries. As for those that don't read the info supplied by Streamlight, they DON'T TAKE RECHARGEABLE batteries.

Comes with a 2 way pocket clip. Folks say it comes off easy, to fix that problem get some mini zip ties, and put it around where the clip attaches to the body, won't come off.

Solid construction, great materials, and made in the USA. Lifetime warranty and comes with both CR123A and AA batteries as well as a small belt pouch. All at a great price.

3,R1DNV7ILTBSSG5,True,One of the best flashlight I could have bought,"One of the best flashlight I could have bought.

First it can run out of 3 different battery type(CR123, AA or AAA) makes it the life saver wherever you are. I prefer to use CR123 for the more powerful light output, but with AA Lithium it run well and long.

The switch is just perferct. High output right on then strobe and low output using quick push to cycle, it is really simple. The possibility to change the way the switch operate through the ""programmable"" function is interesting also, even if i do not use it.

Coming with a belt/mollee pouch is awesome. The 2-way clip allows to carry in a pocket, to attach the light to you cap for hand-free use or like.

4,R210BK0BSGRFWX,True,Bottom line - it's always worked.,"This light served as my vehicle light for close to three years. Replaced the batteries once, and treated it to every imaginable horror it could face. Freezing cold -40 starts, extended runs while searching for lost tent pegs, doused in muddy water and energy drinks, rattling over dirt roads at 80 kph surrounded by loose change and tools. The anodizing has held up, and the lens remains scratch free. There's no failures on the light at all, and everything works perfect - so much that it's now been passed along to be my significant other's purse light - a task I would only let the more trusted of lights fill. There's no real chance of accidental activation, and the tailcap remains tightly screwed on. Every time I reached for that light. it worked. That simple. There's a lot of other, fancier lights out there, with higher lumen counts boasted *cough cough every budget overseas light out there cough cough* (sometimes falsely) and more crazy modes *cough cough nitecore sr7 cough cough*, but this light offers everything you need. Instant high mode, with a second low mode, and the ever present but equally useless, strobe. No mode memory means the batteries never phantom drain, *cough cough thrunight tn12 cough cough* The beam is am excellent white and flawless - a rarity for some cheap lights.

6,R23QWQ0S5QIPYF,True,Very happy with my purchase,"Great torch. Very happy with it. I chose it for the reversible clip (can be cap-mounted; handy when taking it camping, or helmet mounting), and the amount of light it can put out. I'm a structural engineer so a solidly built flashlight is handy on site; I wanted something that can illuminate structure from a decent distance but still fit in my pocket.
It's support of two different battery sizes is a really nice feature too; the CR123A batter will pump out more light, but it'll also take a AA battery which you can pick up anywhere. And you can program it to default to full-power, or a reduced power (usually you only need the lower setting, saving on battery).

14,R2KJT9NXCN5LBJ,True,Great flashlight. Awesome customer service.,"Bright enough to light up a small dark room. Its small and compact, fits in my pocket and at times I forget its even there. I bought one for myself, my friend had an interest so I bought him one too.

* Updated - June 2016 *

I purchased this flashlight back in January l2013 and I had broken the lens during that time. Dust gets into the head/LED housing, and I was careful not to get it wet. After these years I finally decided to have it repaired or replaced.

I registered my information on Streamlight's website, and regarding my purchase and how it got damaged. I then was entered into their system, and then printed the label and sent it to Pennsylvania. I paid about $20.00 with Canada Post for tracking.

Please be advised their lifetime warranty has caveats, but it appears they are understanding on accidental damages. Repair or replacement is their ultimately their decision.

After three weeks I received my a brand new 88031, and I now use this as my EDC personal flashlight only.

**Here are my opinions after having used this flashlight for three years.**

I had no technical issues with it during this time, but I learned that the lens are not shatter proof. Don't hit it on anything that will directly impact the lens.

It's bright on high it got me through parts of the blackout during the Ice Storm of 2013. I do feel that it gets hot quick though. On low it's not that bright, I use it when I only need a little light or to conserve battery. There is also a strobe option which is good for tactical purposes.

Having only three modes is limited for some people in 2016 when there are other flashlights with more options for the price, some even at a lower cost. I paid $40.00 and couldn't be happier in 2013, but I would not pay its full price now because there are newer flashlight with better specs.

It uses 123 lithium batteries which are generally more expensive and not widely available. I bought a pack of 12 Energizers EL123 from Amazon, definitely worth it for the money.

I also tried using an 18650 battery and it appears to work but doesn't shine as bright. I don't believe it's recommended by Streamlight as it is not indicated.

Overall I am still satisfied wit this purchase, it's definitely my EDC as its compact and light, bright for my uses and something I can use for self defence. I actually brought this with me when I went on vacation in Vietnam and then to a Mexico.

I recommend to get this if it's on sale for about $40.00, however for this price you can also get a Thrunite Archer 2A V3, which has more lumens and uses AA-cell batteries. I'd say it's a personal preference e

110,RR21X4TNBHCWY,False,Full Review,"Hello Everyone,

I was very pleased with the initial experience with this light. Having the light come with both fuel options as well as a very well built sheath was a pleasant surprise. The light out of the package is extremely ready to do some serious work for you. At 350 lumens this light is very bright and found no issues with the beam pattern. The flood/spot ratio is right on point for basic EDC tasks. The pocket clip was wonderful. It sat really nicely in my jean pockets and I never felt like it was going to fall out. On the Streamlight website they claim that the pocket clip is “Unbreakable”, I wouldn’t go that far but it will definitely hold up for many years of use. Waterproofing on the light works like expected. I left it inside a full sink of water for about a minute and it came out fine. I’ve had wonderful experiences with Streamlight products lasting in very harsh conditions in the past. No harsh testing was done in this review but it held up to basic day to day issues a light will face.

There are a few things about the light that I wasn’t overly fond about however. I wish there was a bit more texture on the body to help with grip. This light is naturally a little slippery and with the light in wet conditions I had to make sure to keep a very firm grip on the light to keep it in my hands.

I also had some issues when trying to use a rechargeable CR123A in the light after the one that came with the light was finished. When attempting to use the rechargeable CR123A the light would not turn on. I’m not sure why this is so I have regular non-rechargeable Streamlight CR123A’s on order. So just be aware that in some cases only certain batteries will work.

My recommendation: This is a great option for a redundancy light. Place it in your vehicle, bug-out bag, in the garage, and other places where you need a good reliable light. My personal preference when it comes to having an EDC light is something with a little more options in terms of brightness levels. I’ve really become fond of lights with .5 lumen options as I often find myself in situations where anything over 50 lumens can be just too bright (e.g. checking pupils in medical situations, or trying not to wake up people next to me when I need a light in the middle of the night.) The TEN-TAP system does help with this a little bit but it would be nice to have other options then simply high, low, and strobe. I would say if you are on the fence about buying this light then definitely do it. You won’t be disappointed. If you are in a field where you require much versatility out of your light then this might not be for you as a primary light is concerned but it makes for a wonderful back-up.

Have an awesome day,

Rylan

112,R306HRFGIWBF5E,False,"A solid flashlight, as bright as indicated, worth the price","*I carry this light with me on night shifts for the past year, did not purchase through amazon rather via local knife dealer.

PROS

1) 600 lumens as described in the review. Lots of these types of flashlights offered on Amazon boast about lumens i.e. 300, 1000 etc. Most of these are Chinese knock offs of real lights (LIKE THIS ONE!). Streamlight is a reliable brand for torches.

2) Tough, robust, kubaton. Can be used as a self-defense tool in numerous ways

----a) Blinding light can be used to temporarily compromise an attackers vision. Even 1 second of seeing the light is
debilitating.

----b) Can be used as a kubaton to add solidity to a punch.

----c) The jagged edge around the rim at the end where the bulb is can also be used for striking.

----d) Is just big enough that it can be used as a baton, would deliver a heavy blow.

3) Stands up whether rested on bulb end or back end.

4) The button that turns the light is just flush with the beveled edge, limiting the lights ability to be turned on while in a pack or a pocket.

5) Can be programmed to exhibit a certain level of luminosity, although I have never used this function.

6) Button is touch sensitive so it can be temporarily turned on or press harder till it clicks to be turned on permanently.

7) Its a tactical flashlight, meaning that the brightest light is set to go off on the first push of a button.

CONS

1) If you shake the light the battery is a little loose, potentially making a rattle sound, its not a major problem but somewhat annoying.

2) The bulb end is TOO big, it bulges out and really compromises your ability to keep it in a pocket, and sticks out of one of those cell phone pockets on most tactical pants.

3) Drains batteries fast, have already went through a pair only using it off and on for a combined time of about 30 minutes. The light doesn't just die, it just fades away... so for the last part of your battery cycle you may have a 200 lumen light. I've yet to see whether or not this was due to the batteries I used or not.

116,R2USRK3M9UVVVZ,True,"Excellent flashlight, with a great runtime, efficiency, modes, and settings. Note: Product description on Amazon is incorrect.","Excellent flashlight. Before I get into specifics, I must make some corrections to the product description on this page as some of it is incorrect (Not a bad thing, as the actual specs are even better than the ones on Amazon). Here are the proper specs:

-High:
260 Lumens
3h
150m
5,600cd

-Low:
13 Lumens
50h
35m
300cd

Now on to the flashlight itself. It's default mode has three settings (High, high strobe, and low) which one can switch between by gently pressing (not clicking) on the flashlight's button (When gently pressing, the desired mode only stays on as long the button is being pressed), and can select by transitioning from gently pressing to clicking the button when the desired setting is seen (This leaves the desired setting on without the need of a button press to keep it on).

The modes can be changed however. The other 2 pre-programmed modes are:
- High setting only
- Low and high settings only (no strobe)

You can change modes by pressing (not clicking) the button 9 times and holding the button down on the 10th time (not a click) until the light turns off, then release.

Onto my opinion. My only gripes with this flashlight is that there is no SOS mode, and no ability to program the order of the light settings and which ones I want outside of the pre programmed modes. Other than that, this is a superb light with a sturdy and waterproof build (Up to 1 meter underwater) as well as the cheapest flashlight with this high a lumen output (Other brands often have false lumens advertised, so double check before you buy).

The reason why I bought this flashlight is because I live in Canada where it's illegal to carry anything that is purely for the purpose of self-defence or use as a weapon. Canada, namely Ontario, is relatively safe but I always like to be prepared, especially when I walk in areas I consider ""ghetto"", or places where wildlife is less than friendly. This powerful flashlight fills the role of being a good self defence EDC (every day carry) because it has the lumens required to temporarily blind someone (120 lumens and over) in low light situations as well as being made of anodized aluminium and having a bezel which makes it effective enough for striking if an assailant managed to get that close without breaking the lens. One can easily use it to to fill a large area in front of oneself with light in order to survey one's surroundings in low light environments. It is also useful in day to day life like when messing with wires behind a tv, or in power outages.

Overall, I would recommend everyone to have a tactical flashlight as part of their daily kit for both self defence and general utility. I've owned it for just about 2 months and I still haven't had to change the already included batteries. It also comes with a Velcro holster for those who don't have a backpack with a holster or don't want to carry it in their pocket.

I would also recommend everyone to immediately buy a 12 pack of streamlight's CR123A Lithium batteries from Amazon, as you will inevitably use up the ones that come with the flashlight, and all stores sell those batteries for higher prices that are sometimes as ridiculous as 10 dollars a battery if not more, so save your money and buy them along with this flashlight ahead of time because I haven't found them this cheap anywhere else.",canada,"October 5, 2014",poignant potato,5.0,10,2020-10-27 22:28:05.286476,2020-10-27 22:28:05.400655,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

119,R3P07NT7HZO7F7,True,FAKE STREAMLIGHT: 2 of 5 lights.,"I'ts a really nice light, if you get a true Streamlight. 3 settings: Hi, strobe, and low. Hi is bright enough to easily shine across my backyard about 100 feet long. Small enough so it just barely sticks out from my closed fist when held, just enough to use as a strike weapon if needed. Great for EDC. The clip is the key - lets you attach to your cap visor.

The problem: I've bought 5 of these now. Two of them: randomly they would not turn on, when they did work, would not shine brightly, and would make a very soft but high pitched noise. These were counterfeit, but by the time I had used them enough to figure this out, many months had passed, could not return. My last purchase 8/28/18 luckily a real streamlight arrived and works great - below is the list of things you have to check right away, and if these are present, then send it back - see attached photos:

Signs of counterfeit Streamlight:
1. ten-tap programming does not work --> counterfeit
2. unscrew the end cap: if O-ring is BLACK (instead of orange) ---> counterfeit
3. take the end cap off, remove battery - if there is NO SPRING in the front end of the flashlight, where it should contact the battery, --->counterfeit
4. end cap with grid texture pattern instead of the ""SL"" streamlight logo ---> counterfeit

124,R2XCYXXP5GYBUS,True,Geiles Teil!,"Diese Taschenlampe ist echt mega!
Zufällig kam sie genau an dem Tag an dem ich nen Spaziergang durch den Wald gemacht habe. Ich hab das Päckchen aus dem Briefkasten gezogen, die Verpackung aufgerissen, (geht ohne Schere, sehr geil!) Batterie rein (wird mitgeliefert) und los geht's! Ich hab kurz die Anleitung angeschaut weil die Lampe 3 Modi hat und weil's an der Lampe nur einen Knopf gibt.

Jetzt kommt das coole!

1x Drücken = High
2x Antippen und Halten/Drücken = Strobe Mode
3x Antippen und Halten/Drücken = Low

Dieses System finde ich extrem geil weil man sich bei anderen Lampen meistens erst durch die ganzen Modi durchschalten muss bis man den gewünschten Modus erreicht hat. Das kann bei 3 Helligkeitsstufen, Strobo, SOS, etc. manchmal ziemlich nerven. Man kann die Reihenfolge auch umprogrammieren, hab ich aber noch nicht probiert. Ich werde sie aber wahrscheinlich umprogrammieren auf Low, High und dann Strobe.

Hell ist das Teil auch noch! Bei der größe der Lampe hätte ich nicht so viel erwartet, aber da kann sich so manche größere Lampe noch was abschneiden! Ne echt gute Ausleuchtung bis Ca 30m. Helligkeit ja ist immer so ein subjektiver Wert aber ich fand das sie schon echt wirklich gut Hell gemacht hat.

Leider wird die Lampe mit CR123 Batterien betriben. Ich hasse die Dinger weil man die nur bei Amazon oder Ebay zu nen vernünftigen Preis bekommt. Mir macht es auch ein bisschen Sorgen das si ne Batterie im High Modus nur 2 Stunden halten soll. Der Spatziergang ging jetzt leider nicht so lange das ich es heraus gefunden hätte aber 2 Stunden, finde ich, sind nicht so wirklich lange. Der Low Modus ist zwar auch noch OK aber ein bisschen mehr hätte ich mir schon gewünscht.

Nun zur Größe:
Ich wollte ne kleine Lampe die man den ganzen Tag am Gürtel tragen kann (oder sonst wo) und kaum auffällt. Diesem Anspruch wird sie völlig gerecht. Das Ding is nicht länger als meine Hand Breit ist (siehe Foto) der Gürtelclip ist etwas länger und fühlt sich ziemlich robust an. Er wird auf der Herstellerseite als unverwüstlich bezeichnet und das kann ich mir gut vorstellen. Er ist abnehmbar. Ich hoffe mal das ich nicht mal irgendwo hängen bleibe und der Clip abgeht und ich die Lampe verliere. Er sitzt aber bombenfest und man sollte es wahrscheinlich merken wenn der Clip mal ab gehen sollte.

Eigentlich finde ich das der Preis ein wenig hoch ist und die Leuchtdauer würde ich mir auch länger wünschen, aber man bekommt hier wirklich ne echt erstaunlich gute Lampe! Man wird von ihr wahrscheinlich nicht enttäuscht werden.

Ich glaube das ich da einen treuen Alltagsbegleiter gefunden habe. 😊",germany,"January 2, 2016",ChristopherB,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:09.496941,2020-10-27 22:28:09.646841,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

138,R1SYNMEVFCXP6S,True,Perfect EDC light,"Small, bright, lightweight, programmable. Perfect EDC light. There really isn't a reason/excuse to not carry a flashlight - everyday. The ProTac 1L-1AA is a great flashlight and I think it will end up passing up the ProTac 1L and 2L models in popularity. If you were like me, you are wondering - ""how can a flashlight take a small CR123A and a AA battery?"". When you unscrew the cap, you will notice the AA battery slides down into a retainer that has a spring on the bottom side. The AA will protrude out of the end of the flashlight, but you just compress the battery down as you screw on the end cap. Easy. The CR123A's fit flush. It's a great concept. Ten-Tap programmable so you can run it in different modes: High, Low/High, or High/Strobe/Low. Just momentary press the end cap 9 times and press to click on the 10th. Great flashlight.

*UPDATE*
It has been one year since this review. I have carried this light in my left back pocket daily. A few drops, scuffs and scratches but it is holding up just fine. Wrapped 14"" inches of duct tape around the middle because duct tape is always good to have with you. And, it adds a little grip too. It's a great light.

これだけいろいろ対応してくれていれば困ることはないんじゃないかと安心していられますが、欲を言えばもう少し暗くてもいいので、ランタイムを長くするモードを新設して欲しいです。ついでに言っちゃうと14500もサポートしてトリフューエルにしましょうよ。そしたら更に一本買います。

148,R1FILTIOXATCL2,True,(Compleatly Updated) Long Term Usage Review,"I have had this light for about 2 years , and have found it to be an excellent light for the price. It works wonderfully off of primary cells (CR123), but is somewhat touchy when it comes to 18650s you have to make sure you get the right ones. I can also verify that the button top cells from orbtronic work well. I'm sure there are several other brands that will work fine, but I tried at least one brand that would not contact the terminal on the inside of the flashlight because the tip of the battery would not reach down far enough. Just stay with a brand that tightly follows spec.

All that aside, the things I do like about this light a lot are:

1: The belt clip is great for deep pocket carry though I wish that the small part of the clip were about an inch longer to get a better grip on your pocket when the flashlight is being carried tip down, and the pocket is not quite deep enough. That is not a problem if you're OK carrying the flashlight tip up.

2: Two years later, I still feel the output of the flashlight is spectacular for a light of this size, having a slightly larger head then many lights in this class it has a much better more focused throw then some other lights with the same lumen output. I'm sure other lights are out there that are brighter, but this is right at that place where it's ""bright enough"" and if you make it brighter it eats batteries and just kills people's eyes.

3. Burn time has proven to be so much better than I initially expected from a light this bright and powerful. I've used it with the afformentioned orbtronic 3400mah 18650's and gotten through entire evenings of standing in the rain doing service work on only a couple of batteries for 4-5 hours of mostly continuous with some intermittent run time. I generally carry (4) 18650's when I go out on a night call and I've never used more than 2 and just starting into the 3rd when we wrapped up the call (which was 5 hours) Buy a good multi bank charger, because these larger cells charge slowly if you drain them all the way. It's better for them if you stop half way ( soon as it starts to dim) and swap to another battery than to burn that one to the ground. So buy around 8 cells and rotate them through the charger. Get yourself a StoreACell for 18650's for the other 4 to keep on you in a bag.

4: This flashlight also has the right modes, especially for a tactical light or a work light. I prefer run mine on the mode which gives you high first/then strobe/then low, but as a work light it can also be set on High Only.

The great thing about it is, you don't have to cycle all the way through in order to get back around. If you turn it on high, and turn it back off that's all you'll ever see you don't have to click through all the modes. If you turn it on high and double bump it you'll get strobe, but if you turn it off you'll never see the logo mode, because when you turn it back on again it starts over at high. That's what I want in a tactical light, I wouldn't even care if this light didn't even have a low on it.

It does have two other modes, if you prefer A different selection or order of the settings.

5: Durability: having now owned this for almost 2 years and carried it literally every day in pocket...this is a tough light. Mine has dings, scratches, road rash, most of the anodizing is wearing off (which means I'm rubbing the outer layer of aluminum off the barrel in my pocket)... but the light is as bright as when I bought it, the switch still works perfectly (which is where all my other lights normally fail) and I could not be happier with the small exception of just wishing for a slightly modified pocket clip design.

Compared to other brands I've owned that were this durable and pleasant to use with features anywhere close... I could buy two possibly three lights like these for the price of the brand I was using before, and those did not use recharging batteries, only CR123...so cost was killing me.

Best compliment I can give to any tool...

151,RILMQBF8QMRQ3,True,USB charge great. Bright light! Okayish battery. Lacking low batt warning!,"I've had this light on my duty belt for a little over a year now. I've used it nightly as my main flashlight during my shift.

Pros:
1. Very, very, bright. This will light up any space you're looking to light up, whether a room or vehicle. It's also great at temporarily blinding anyone you shine it at.
2. Comfortable and light on a duty belt.
3. Charge right in my car without the need for anything other than what I use to charge my phone.
(micro usb charger)
4. Feels very well made and reliable. I don't worry that dropping it will turn it into a $100 paper weight.

Cons:
1. Battery life. I feel like I can't get more than 4 days of routine patrol work out of this light. Perhaps using the light for a few minutes a handful of times a night.
2. Battery life (again). If I don't use this light the battery somehow still discharges. I can leave the light in my locker for a week while on vacation and return to a dead battery.
3. No low battery warning. Time and time and time again the light has surprised me in turning itself off at the absolute worst times. It gives me no indication that the battery is low or needs recharging. I've been caught walking up to traffic stops with the light suddenly turning off within a second of me trying to use it.
4. Expensive. I lose flashlights like I lose sunglasses, both equally as expensive. You can buy a cheap Chinese light at 1/10th of the price. At the end of the day I still bought this Streamlight for the same reason I still buy Oakleys.

The product loses two starts because of the lacking low battery indicator. Streamlight markets directly to law enforcement and a low battery indicator is pretty critical to our profession. Flashlight going dead without warning is like being caught with your pants down and having to run back to my gear bag for a second flashlight isn't ideal in every situation.",the united states,"March 7, 2018",NJLEO,3.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:26.554225,2020-10-27 22:28:26.676515,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

152,R2HV3HAXVN6R6G,True,Duel fuel? More like 5 fuels!!,"This is a great light for several reasons. I keep one in all the cars with a cr123 in them for emergency needs. They just work when you need them. Nice and small, also carry one on me or in my briefcase.

It takes at least 5 different types of battery that I have found so far. I know that streamlight specifically states not to use Rcr123a rechargeables, but they work fine. Even better is that it runs on 14500 batteries. Now you do lose the low brightness when using rechargeables, it’s more like bright and slightly less bright. Strobe still works fine. But it is brighter than using cr123s for sure. I’ve done some pretty extensive testing with this and have run into no reliability issues yet. So you can run off 1AA, 1AAA, Cr123, Rcr123a, and 14500.

In my testing a 800Mah 14500 will run bright for about an hour. Then it will diminish from about 280 lumens to about 50 lumens (as unscientificly measured against other flashlights of known lumen output) over the next 30 minutes. I stop testing at 1.5 hours, but expect it would just continue to dim and probably give you another 15-30 minutes of useable light. The light gets just as warm as it does with a Cr123 and then cools as the lumens decrease.

The best part is that as compared to my Streamlight 2L-X it has slightly better throw. The 2L-X most likely still puts out more lumens, but it is hard to tell in the dark. They look nearly identical. This light just throws slightly farther and still has great spill.

This light is nice and small and the clip is perfect for a hat brim or a pocket. The emitter is a bit more neutral white, but still a cooler color. Certainly not as yellow as a zebra headlamp in neutral. It is a nice bright neutralish cool white.

I suspect streamlight doesn’t advertise the battery capability because they want to keep selling their Cr123 batteries. That or what I’m doing will kill the emitter quicker. Maybe both. Regardless, I have a bunch of these little lights as they have become my favorite.

Stash them with Cr123s for emergencies, EDC/ use with a 14500 and carry a Cr123 as a back up.

154,R1RVOEQ43EKRME,True,"It's a streamlight, it speaks for itself","You're buying a streamlight so you should already know what you're getting. But i'll briefly go over everything.

Drawing the light:
I planned to carry this tip down, but it turns out, the tip-up carry constitutes a very fast draw. You slip your thumb into your pocket and you've basically already got a full grip on the light, your thumb is already in place to actuate the tail switch. Great for tactical situations.

The Tail switch:
Has a sort of long travel before it switches all the way to constant on, but I like this because it gives you more wiggle room to keep it on momentary on without accidentally clicking it in. The interface is simple and easy to use as well.

The Clip:
The clip is genius. It is strong enough to make sure it won't fall out but smooth enough so that drawing it is very smooth and does not catch on anything. Very useful in a tactical situation. I was afraid the clip would be flimsy from the pictures, but it's a very durable clip. You can even clip it to your hat or shirt collar for hands-free light. It conceals in the pocket nicely and doesn't stick out like you think it would.

The Beam:
It's kind of weird. There is a blue ring around the spill area and the hotspot has a somewhat orange glow around it. But it is very bright and can blind someone, which is what I was looking for. 500 lumens is bright! The low mode is great for EDC use and not blinding yourself. The strobe is slow enough to be effective.

The construction:
Very durable yet very lightweight. Nice and thick, also has good seals and the threads are lubed. If you are familiar with the amazing protac 2AAA, you'll notice the finish is slightly different. I personally like the finish better on this one and noticed it hasn't worn off like my old streamlight.",the united states,"April 24, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:26.953766,2020-10-27 22:28:27.078438,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

156,R24I93ITCS0HJ8,True,Not what I expected of Streamlight...,"I own seven Streamlight products. Weapon lights and flashlights. This unit was just comparatively below par. The finish was blotchy, the LED was off-center in the reflector, and the tail cap operation was just imprecise and cheap feeling. I immediately suspected a counterfeit, so I went on YouTube and found videos on how to spot Streamlight fakes. By all indications, the light I received is NOT a fake...it's disappointingly genuine. I really hate to think this is a trend in the quality of Streamlight products, as I like to buy from USA based companies...especially ones who support our troops and first responders... wherever possible. I have to add that, by comparison, the Fenix brand lights I have seen recently are obviously superior to this Streamlight, both in terms of value and function. I really hope this was a one-off for Streamlight.
UPDATE: I ordered another of this same light from a very reputable photo/video website, to see if the quality might be better somehow. Although the LED was better centered in the reflector, the tail cap switch was still odd. There is a lot of ""empty"" space in the rubber switch before actuation, and even then it feels as if there are loose BBs or something similar inside to make the activation. As a result, you have to push your thumb or finger deep into the cavity of the tail cap to get a momentary or instant on. Difficult with bare fingers....likely impossible with gloves or when in a hurry. Just mystified as to why Streamlight would think this is good function.",the united states,"January 31, 2019",Rick,2.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:27.207726,2020-10-27 22:28:27.355412,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

158,R1JKT3VACREKKO,True,Excellence from Streamlight,"I used a Surefire Fury on-duty for almost four years. After watching and reading a bunch of reviews on Streamlight's newer offerings, particularly the HL-X, I figured I'd give it a shot.

All I can say is wow. For the money, this Streamlight tops Surefire. Sorry, Surefire fanboys. But at this price, the thousand lumens, and Streamlight's customer service... they've got it dialed in at the moment.

This sucker is bright, very well built, and boasts respectable battery life. I added the Thyrm Switchback and Streamlight rechargeable battery for it and could not be more more pleased with the performance.

My only gripe is the programming options via TEN-TAP. Generally, I want ALL the Lumens. All 1,000 please. So I need that first tap to be HIGH. The strobe is useless for me, though. I would like to be able to cycle the light High - Medium - Low, as opposed to High - Strobe - Low. I understand there is a Low - Medium - High option... but that doesn't work for me.

163,R3MQG5JJAY7IO0,True,Everything you think it will be,"I’m a plumber and this flashlight get used every single day, many times a day. Typically I’ll wait to write a detailed review, but this flashlight has proven to be tough regularly. It gets used in crawlspaces, basements, under sinks, and at night all the time. I️ use it for probably about an hour or more every day! It can stand to be dropped, submerged, and ran continuously. It’s programmable and it’s my preference to keep it on the L-M-H setting so the battery lasts longer unless a high power is called for. It is bright when it needs to be, but conserves battery life as well. I️ can safety charge it once every couple of days without issue, possibly even a week if it doesn’t get used often, but like I️ said it gets used multiple times a day.

165,R261QHEGL2VOJN,True,Bright and Functional; Not Too Big For EDC,"Love this light. I previously had three ProTac 2Ls and wanted some more power after losing my last 2L. Bought the 2L-X and was concerned it was going to be a bit bulky for EDC in casual clothes... It's not. While I wouldn't want anything larger, this is a good size for EDC while being big enough to get a solid grip for tactical use.

This light is plenty bright for any application. It's really great how powerful lights this size have become. The beam is great with a strong hot spot for distance use, while having a nice wide spill for peripheral illumination of close objects. I also find the low setting really good for indoor non-tactical use, like looking under a couch for the remote or under your car's seat for your phone.

I can attest to this being plenty water/shock proof in casual use. It's been in the rain with no issue. I haven't submerged my 2L-X but I will say my first two 2Ls were killed by short term submersion (within what they're rated for), so I don't trust that I can submerge my 2L-X without issues.

166,R2H8ZIZ6SNQLU5,True,Will Not Hold Charge,Purchased this flashlight a year ago for the rechargeable battery and three levels of brightness (lumen output). It simply has never held a charge. I followed the directions when I first received it but the battery will not hold a charge. At first I could charge it and use it for 20 to 30 minutes and turn if off. Try to use it again within a day or two and it would be completely dead. Now I charge it just so I can use it for up to an hour and its dead again. Or turn it off for a couple hours and the battery is dead again. Also disliked the fact that it did not have a focal / spot adjustment and the brightness adjustment was overly complicated.

172,R36CDJ2L3X4NR3,True,"The Streamlight Protac HL works well in the end, but not without hastle and more money spent in the begininng.","I bought this flashlight because I work security detail in an ugly part of my city, and when I need a flashlight, I need it to work consistently every time - because my life could depend on it. For a standard flashlight, that may be too much to ask for, but for a flashlight of this reputation and price, I was expecting much more. I bought the Streamlight Protac HL 2 months ago. It worked for about a month (long enough for the return time to expire), and then the 600 lumen output drastically decreased. I assumed it was exhausted batteries, and so I bought a new package of batteries. The Streamlight did not regain its 600 lumen output. It put out less than 200 lumen, in my estimations. At times the light did not turn on at all when the switch was pressed. I assumed that this was my fault, that maybe I didn't know how to use the Streamlight's ""ten-tap"" technology. After all, I couldn't find anything on the internet suggesting that anyone had ever had a problem with a Streamlight. I even bought another package of batteries, just to be sure that expired batteries weren't to blame. Sure enough, it was a problem with the flashlight. Bear in mind, I had not abused the light, submerged it, dropped it, exposed it to shock or high heat, and I would go as far as to say I babied it. It spent most of its time in the holster, on my belt.

Streamlight has a limited lifetime warranty on parts defects, and so I decided to send the flashlight to the Streamlight repair facility, after filling out an online repair form on Streamlight's website, accompanied by a detailed description of the problem. I asked them to call me with their findings. I paid for 2 day priority mail, it was shipped within 2 days to their facility, and by the morning of the 3rd day, it was marked as shipped back to customer. I called them and asked what the problem was with my light, and they said it was that I must be using bad or inferior batteries, because they couldn't find anything wrong with the light. I told them that there was indeed a problem with the light, and that I had used both Energiser and Duracell batteries with expiration dates of 2021, and they said that I must be mistaken, and that they strongly recommend more new batteries. Personally, I don't think they looked at it at all.

When the flashlight shipped back to me, I decided to inspect it myself. I figured I'd lose nothing since honoring the warranty was seemingly ignored by Streamlight, and as is, I had a useless paperweight of a flashlight. I started by cutting the rubber button on the tail-cap off, exposing the ""guts"" of the flash-light's switch, and immediately exposing the problem: corrosion in the tail-cap. An easy fix that I believe that Streamlight should have easily found and fixed. I ordered a new tail-cap on eBay for $16, and the light works like new.

In the end: Does the light work now? Yes, but because I fixed the problem.
Did it work in the beginning? No.
Did Streamlight honor the warranty? No. They insinuated that I was mistaken to weasel out of warranty work, and offered no solution to the problem.
Total cost of flash light after repairs, shipping, and batteries: Easily over $100
Would you recommend this product? No. The product is made in China, offers quality craftsmanship, but poor quality control, and customer service is marginal at best. For you to buy a flash light this expensive, you would have to need it for a tactical/emergency situation, and if it doesn't work in even simple situations, you have a serious problem.

I will probably get steam-rolled for this negative review, but I can only report my experience. I can't speak for the entire Streamlight brand, nor other model flashlights of this brand.

I read comments on the reviews about fakes having black o-rings, and legit only have red o-rings. THIS IS NOT TRUE. My Streamlight has black o-rings and silver springs.
I contacted Streamlight directly and asked about it, gave my S/N to see if it was a fake.
This is the response from Streamlight;

174,R1XNHDD1JXVJ9L,True,REAL vs fake 88061 lights,"The purpose of this review is to describe additional subtle differences between genuine and fake flashlights.

The background story is that I bought this light because I had a handful of CR123 batteries that weren't good enough to drive a smoke detector but still registered reasonable life on a voltmeter -- so I wanted to use those up rather than dispose of good batteries, but I didn't want to be locked into a CR123-only light.

I initially bought a light from what looked like a reputable seller on eBay. The light arrived and as far as I could tell, both packaging and light looked genuine. Other reviewers have pointed out that fake lights:
1. don't include batteries
2. don't have a SL logo on the button
3. have a black-colored tailcap gasket (instead of orange)
4. does not have springs on both ends of the light to hold the battery

The light I received did not have any of these issues so I felt pretty good about having received a genuine light.
However, some reviews also point out that in addition to all of the above, counterfeit lights also cannot be programmed using SL's Ten-tap system, and this was true of my light. When I tried to program the light using Ten-tap, the light would stay on with the 10th click/hold, rather than extinguish like a real light. So, I started to wonder if this was actually a fake light.

I ordered another light directly from Amazon (Amazon was the vendor) which I received today and it appears that this new light is genuine. When I stare at the two lights and packaging side-by-side, the differences are EXTREMELY subtle, to the point that I had to wonder if the original light simply had a malfunctioning Ten-tap and that the differences I was seeing were simple manufacturing variance.

On the attached photos, the suspected counterfeit light is on the top, and the real light (shipped from Amazon proper) is on the bottom.

Here are the additional differences that I have found:
1. The ink used on the real light is a bit thicker than the counterfeit one - the fake one has ink that is slightly translucent and makes it look a bit like a factory second. This is really subtle and difficult to tell unless you have a real/fake side-by-side.
2. The word ""TEN-TAP"" on the flashlight is the same height and font size as the adjacent word ""PROGRAMMABLE"". On the fake one the ""TEN-TAP"" is just slightly more squished and lower height than the adjacent word, as if the aspect ratio were off.
3. The line spacing of the text above and below ""Patented"" is equal on the real light whereas on the counterfeit light
the S/N line is much closer to ""Patented"" than is the ""TEN-TAP"" line. Again unnoticeable unless you are aggressively comparing a real and counterfeit light side-by-side.
4. The machining of the knurling on the tailcap is different. On a legitimate light, there is a slight 3D depth to the texture -- the grooves are both wide AND deep enough to catch a fingernail. The fake light has a texture that is smoother and with grooves that are more shallow.
5. The lanyard hole on the real light was smaller than the one on the fake light I received (see pic #2)
6. The overall texture of the light on the fake light had a textured glossiness (but very smooth to the touch) vs. a more textured matte finish on the genuine light (pic #2)
7. On the pocket clip there are two cutout notches flanking the long part of the clip that are oriented parallel to the axis of the light -- they are slightly longer on the real light than the fake light (pic #3)
8. The button/switch action is much smoother and easier to depress with the genuine light
9. FInally, on the packaging, the fake light had a California Prop 65 cancer warning (the real one didn't, surprisingly.) On both packages (real and fake) the cardboard insert had a cutout that showed the flashlight -- the real packaging had a corresponding cutout on the plastic packaging while the fake one had plastic covering the cutout.

So, that's it. These are immensely subtle differences and without an actual side-by-side comparison, I think they would be quite difficult to identify in isolation.

175,RUH6CKQNZ6AIL,True,Lasted a little over a year.,"I really loved this light until it stopped working. It's really bright, has a solid build and is very versatile with the different modes. I always used the 18650 rechargeable batteries and battery life was great. But just today, a year and three months after getting it, it started having problems. I'm assuming it's the switch, which apparently is a somewhat common problem with Streamlights. If it gets shaken moderately or bumped while on, it will shut off. Turning it off and back on sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. While it's in this condition, no modes beyond low power on/off are available. If you wait a few seconds before turning it back on, it seems to work normally until it gets shaken or bumped again. And I'm not talking severe shaking or bumping. Just the kind of movement you'd use to roll a pair of dice. This light has been in my pocket since I bought it and has seen only very limited use. It's a tactical light intended primarily to be used with my firearm. I use other larger lights for the day to day utility tasks. Now I'm certainly no stranger to having flashlights fail on me, nor is anyone else who's used them extensively, especially those of us in public service that regularly depend on them. But Streamlight is the quality light you spend much more money on so you won't have those kinds of problems. I didn't expect it to last forever, but I certainly thought it would last at lot longer than a year with only limited use. I saw an officer in one review state the axiom that two lights are one and one light is none, and there's very good reasons why we say that. Carrying an extra light in uniform isn't a huge deal, but it's another story when you're plainclothes. I'll probably end up with two lights since there don't seem to be any better choices, but I'm highly disappointed in a product this expensive that only lasted this long. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because it was a fantastic light when it worked.

EDIT 1/26/2020: It appears my problems may have been related to a bad battery. It's been working well for about a week now with a new battery. But since I can't see how a battery could affect switch functions or cause vibration issues, I'm only going to raise my rating to 3 stars for now. If it keeps working well for a few more weeks or so, I'll come back and adjust the rating accordingly.",the united states,"January 15, 2020",Rhino Bob,3.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:42.080525,2020-10-27 22:28:42.200296,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

176,R1LDWUTOLURPIT,True,"Very nice flashlight, with a few quibbles","I bought this as a lightweight option to mount on my home defense firearm. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting, and lighter, too. I will be buying another for dedicated EDC pocket carry. I'm taking a star off for a few quibbles that bug me.
First, the pros. This thing is a lot smaller than I anticipated. That was a majorly pleasant surprise. Being more compact, it's also a lot lighter. Given this is mounted on my firearm, I'm definitely a fan. There are times when I like my lights to have some heft, but firearm mount is not one of them. Another major (and obvious) pro is the option for two different kinds of batteries. I personally use the CR123 option for the firearm as it's brighter, but with pocket carry I'm more inclined to use an AA lithium battery for the longer life. It's nice to have that kind of flexibility either way. There are not a lot of flashlights out there that give you multiple options in terms of how you power it.
The cons (for me). The tail cap switch is mildly infuriating, in terms of trying to get the light turned on to the setting I want. The first day or two I kept doing full clicks trying to get to the low brightness setting, or even the strobe, but could not for the life of me do anything more than just turn it on or off. It wasn't until several days later and finally googling the flashlight to find out you do a rapid ""half-click"" either twice (for strobe) or three times (for low brightness), with the last half-click actually being a full click to set it. So, you'd do a single full click for full brightness, half-click full click for strobe, or half-click half-click full click for low brightness. You think that sounds complicated? Wait until you actually try to do it. Either I'm horribly uncoordinated or slightly on the low end of the IQ scale, because it was maddeningly infuriating to attempt my various combinations of half-clicks and full clicks before I'd finally end up on the setting I was going for. After all those attempts, I've decided I'm good with just a single full click to turn it on, on the HD gun. The second quibble is the price. I paid about forty bucks for the light, only a few dollars more than either the CR123-only version or the AA-only version. That in and of itself is not a terrible price to pay for a decently bright flashlight. My issue is, this is not the only flashlight I've ever bought in my life. And there are others out there that are the same quality, but with far more features, for only a few bucks more in price. Granted, they're also bigger and heavier with longer run times on their batteries, but I'm having a hard time reconciling the price/value balance of this light, when I try it out alongside those.
Again, those quibbles are just me, and my own subjective biased opinion. Your mileage may vary. At the end of the day, I like it enough that I'm buying another one, and I'd gladly recommend the light to friends and family.",the united states,"September 21, 2016",Warren G,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:42.205282,2020-10-27 22:28:42.346777,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

177,R8LMMDNT6X6M0,True,One and done.,"This is a really cool flashlight.
I am not much of a flashlight guy... I'm more a knife guy. (we all have our thing, ya know?).
So I did a bunch of research when I figured I wanted an LED flashlight.
I have always used MagLites for home/camping/backpacking/work/etc... so I figured that one would do. I love the brand and their quality is and has always been awesome.
But then I heard something in a random review about a flashlight that can use a couple of different batteries...? whaaaat?
After more research I settled on this one (for price point and functionality. I don't need more than 3 settings anyway.)
It came with 2 batteries - standard AA and the CR123... OH YEAH. (So, the CR123 is a better battery, more powerful, that's the one I put in there. Well, I hit the LOW beam for a split second the other night to find something on my side of the bed. My wife woke up from a dead sleep and exclaimed 'OW' because the room lit up like an invasion. Seriously, it took me by surprise too.
Haven't had a chance to check the durability factor yet. I will though when we go camping this summer.
Real easy to use, just be careful, IT IS BRIGHT.

178,R1DPQJ2JJ4YP18,True,2 year review. Buy Surefire instead. (You get what you pay for),"I have purchased 2 of these and carried each as my EDC. The first one would work fine, but.... I would use it once per night to walk our dogs for less than 2 minutes. I would NOT use the light for 2 minutes, but just flash it once in a while to get my bearings, worked great. During the first month of use, I noticed that the light would be slightly dimmer each week, which was perfectly acceptable. BUT then all of a sudden one day it was just DEAD. No light at all. Like it would have 50% power on Tuesday and Wednesday it was DEAD. First couple of times this happened I assumed that the light was being turned on by mistake and that would drain the battery; I experimented and discovered that this was not user error and the light was faulty. Shortly after discovering this, I lost the light; so I purchased a second one hoping for better luck. I was wrong. After a few months of using it in the same manner listed above, it was noticed that the light would flicker from time to time (which is a bad sign for a light). In sort, BUY A SUREFIRE.

It's by far my favorite every day carry light. It's bright enough for anything you'd need it for and small enough to fit comfortably in your pocket. The batteries last long enough with sparing use, especially if you make use of the lower light option, which is sufficient for most any day-to-day task.

My biggest hint to maybe save you all from having to make multiple purchases due to lost light is to take some electrical tape and wrap it around the light near the clip and a bit around the end of the clip itself. Without this modification, the clip is not very secure in your pocket. I lost one flashlight at some point during a night out, never to be seen again.

180,R3MFE0UK7QFHX4,True,NOT 1000 Lumens!! Misleading!,"Streamlight has gone downhill since moving manufacturing to China. This light is not at all as bright as my 6-year old Surefire P2X Fury that's rated at 500 lumens; yes, half that of this PROTAC HL. The Surefire has a smoother and more neutral white light (vs this bluish light), and has a far greater throw (tested both at night to light up treetops. The kicker is that this light is about an inch longer, and wider throughout, that the surefire.
It's incredible to me that Streamlight appears to be moving backwards while Surefire continually innovates (the newest Fury is rated up to 1,500 lumens with Intelibeam technology). It also doesn't help that this light is manufactured in China, while Surefire still makes them in good 'ol USA.
Perhaps it's the great tech Surefire has invested in their reflectors, or the efficiency of their LED's. Whatever it is, it's far better than this rubbish. At this price, you could get about 2-3 off-brand ones that are just as inadequate.

181,R1DISPCWB9WGWV,True,Bright compact light for EDC.,"I was looking for a light for everyday pocket carry, and this is small enough that it is usually in my pocket. Though I like the battery flexibility of the 1L-1AA, the smaller size of this light was the deciding factor for me. The hi setting is amazingly bright for a light this small, and the low setting is a bit brighter than I'd like. The high-frequency strobe is definitely an attention-getter, and would likely be a distraction if it were shone into the eyes of an attacker. The beam pattern is exactly what I'd like: a strong center with moderate beam spread (enough to light the full width of a walking path when held at waist-height) and a very wide low intensity spill -- it's the perfect middle ground between flood and spot.

182,R9HEE2A3N1RJ9,True,Almost the perfect patrol flashlight,"Almost the perfect patrol light.

I'm using high quality 18650 olight batteries, not sure of the runtime but it is at least an hour on full. This thing is super bright and lights up everything with the perfect balance of throw and spill. High is brigher than the car spot-light, it blazes through tinted windows and gives a great view of the inside.

It is a great size and the grip is really fantastic in a gloved or bare hand. Makes a good club when needed. It fits in a duty belt ring with no problem and is easy to carry. I've dropped tested it onto pavement multiple times and it is surviving (so far).

It is almost the perfect flashlight, with two minor exceptions. It needs a programming mode high-med-low instead of low-med-high. The default of high-strobe-low is what I am using, meaning I have no medium . Low is fine for reading documents, walking a trail, or whatever, but I think it would be nice to use medium. I don't like low-med-high as I need high to come on right away, there is always time to cycle to low. Strobe is nearly useless since high is plenty for disorientation. Second is it would benefit from a side switch for different shooting platforms.

183,RL0ZRL6J1PL2V,True,"Excellent light, bought 3 now.","This is the absolute, best, perfect for me flashlight I've ever owned. This is actually the 3rd one I've bought, and it wasn't because the first two quit working or anything, it's because they keep disappearing! The size and weight are amazing for a flashlight that puts out as much light as this one. I've dropped them plenty of times with no issues, I've worn the finish off on my previous ones but they still keep going. The 10 tap programming lets me set the light to low-med-high, which is perfect for my line of work. Low is bright without being overpowering when working inside machines, and bright is enough to see what's in the woods behind my house from my back porch (a few hundred feet away). I've got quite a few battery packs and usb solar panels, so I'll always be able to recharge the flashlight, power or no power, and the ability to take 18650 and CR123 batteries means this light will never be dead.

184,R16D6Z9MWPCNYP,True,Beware of fakes. How to tell ProTac is not counterfeit,"I really like this light, so ordered my second one. It didn't have the normal signs of being a counterfeit, so I thought I had a real Streamlight. Ten Tap programming didn't work, so I compared it with my other ProTac 1L-1AA. The light was slightly dimmer, more yellow and the beam pattern was not as smooth as an authentic Streamlight, but these would not be apparent unless you are able to do a side by side comparison.

Ways to tell if you have a real ProTac:
1. Try Ten Tap programming. Rapidly click the switch 9 times and hold down on the 10th. The light should switch modes.
2. CR123A battery should have a 4 digit date code between the + and - markings.
3. Rubber tail switch should have the Streamlight logo, not a cross hatch pattern
4. The two battery springs inside the light should be gold, not silver
5. The clam shell packaging should include a Streamlight CR123A battery and an Energizer AA battery

Fakes used to fail all 5 tests. The one I got failed 1 and 2, but passed 3 through 5.

So why 4 stars? It's not Streamlight's fault others try to copy their success. I docked a star because the light cannot stand on end to light a room. Otherwise this is an excellent EDC light. It's priced lower than most other well made EDC lights, dual fuel capability is a bonus and it delivers great lumens for such a small package. I like the size and clip of the Zebralight SC52 better than the ProTac, but the tail switch of the ProTac makes this more useful as an EDC light. Also build quality of Streamlight is tough to beat.

This would be my #1 recommendation for someone wanting a small (i.e., not key chain) EDC light.",the united states,"February 11, 2018",Thucydides,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:47.457821,2020-10-27 22:28:47.579420,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

185,R1PJO62SCLNXVE,True,Honest Review,"My father lost his tactical light recently and so what better way to gift him for his birthday than to provide him with another tactical light. I did so much online research before I came to this conclusion. When you are looking for a tactical light, you want to keep these in mind; maximum lumen output, battery life, tactical uses, light modes (strobe and different lumen outputs). Otherwise you might as well just get a standard flashlight.

This one fills nearly all of those criteria. It has a quick and easy usb charger which is a plus because you won't have to keep buying batteries. There are the standard strike bezels in the front for use as a melee weapon. It's maximum lumen output is blinding (I'm not exaggerating). The strobe mode is a great tool for self defense as well. We tested it and I couldn't see anything but a white strobe. The battery life at the higgest lumen output is pretty good itself. Usually some other tac lights last only an hour or so at their maximum output, this one lasts way longer. You can increase this battery life by switching to a lower lumen output by quickly double tapping the power button. Triple tap it, if you want to activate the strobe feature.

It is to my understanding that this flashlight has two models. The one I gifted my dad has the High, Low and Strobe setting. And I believe the other model has High, Medium, Low and Strobe. Although I have not found the other one on the market at all yet.

There are definitely other Tactical Lights that are as great or greater than this one. But that doesn't mean this aggressive looking flashlight doesn't deserve it's 5 stars for exemplary performance. I wouldn't mind getting myself one as well, but I'll have to wait, as I'm only a student and this current Covid-19 situation has put me out of a job.",the united states,"July 5, 2020",Hue C.,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:28:47.583417,2020-10-27 22:28:47.702680,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

186,R24FGA4LJ0N3QS,True,"which are functioning just fine, and need to purchase the protected 18650 version","This is for the ProTac 2L-X Ten Tap 500 Lumens.

First, let me say, it's very bright and very compact. I bought it to use for walking my dogs at night. I was previously using an UltraStinger LED, which I felt was to much flashlight for the job. In comparing the the two on high mode, the ProTac seems roughly half as bright. According to Streamlight specs for both, that would be about right. I used the ten tap programming to start it in low mode so I don't disturb the neighbors, and it's still giving me plenty of light, quite a bit more than my mini Maglite led. On this setting, the specs say it will run for 30 hours on the CR123A batteries, and it will probably run longer on the 18650 rechargeable. That's a lot of light for such a small package.

On Amazon the info says ""Dual Fuel use 2x CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-iON Batteries."" I checked the Streamlight website, they said ""uses two CR123A lithium batteries (included) or one Streamlight rechargeable 18650 lithium ion battery."" So I bought 6 18650 rechargeable UNPROTECTED Li-iON Batteries and a charger, to go with my new flashlight. When I rec'd the flashlight, it came with two CR123A batteries. Upon reading the operating instructions that came in the box, it states the light will also function if you install a Streamlight #22101 or commercially available ""Li Ion18650 PROTECTED cylindrical 3.7V 2600mAh 'button top' rechargeable battery"". So now I'm stuck with 6 unprotected 18650 batteries, which are functioning just fine, and need to purchase the protected 18650 version. Ok, not Streamlights fault. I should have done my homework. So in short, if you're buying the 18650 batteries, make sure you get the protected 'button type'.

Anyway, I like it a lot. I already dropped it on the sidewalk, oops! And it still works fine. This flashlight is no joke, and in my opinion, well worth the 50 bucks.

187,R3N1DOC1MB4KQR,True,ProTac XL-X: Excellent EDC Light,"Excellent little light ( ProTac HL-X ). The TapTen programming lets you enable and disable lighting modes you don't use. Very bright on high, blinding. I especially like the low and medium settings since low is still bright enough for a lot of general use and medium is bright enough to temporarily blind someone, but without the high power drain of the full 1000 lumens.

Battery life seems to be good, I haven't drained the ones that came with it. You can also use 18650 batteries if you want rechargeable ""high capacity"" batteries. The clip is good, can be used to hang in your pocket or off the brim of a hat for head mounting, but could have a stronger spring to it.

I love the tough construction, it feels very solid in the hand, and the angles on the head casing keep it from rolling around on a table.

The one downside is the beam is not adjustable. You can't get a really wide flood, but the fixed beam does have a nice spotlight in the middle with a good transition of illumination to the edges.

188,R2VVAZZQ2CTOZB,True,"Great flashlight, durable, tough, and bright!","I'm a bit of a flashlight freak, I probably have $2000 in flashlights of various types, but most of them are higher-end tactical type flashlights.

People certainly use flashlights differently, they are not a one size fits all product, but with a couple of dozen mid to high-grade flashlights of various types and brands I have to say that for my daily work this flashlight has been my go-to over all of the rest, none of the others have the USB rechargeable feature with the lighting program I prefer.

I use my flashlights primarily for inspection work that I do and this flashlight has a program where it cycles from low power to high power with each momentary tail click and it returns to low power after turning the light off. I really like this program, I don't get blinded in really dark situations and I'm always just a click away from a little bit more power...all via the operation of the tail switch. My ProTac has been dropped, tossed, kicked, flipped...you name it, it looks terrible, but still works.

The only problem I've had is that occasionally the light doesn't start on the first click, it just flashes once, then I have to re-click the switch. It's pretty random when this happens, I keep it charged, so I don't think that it is the battery, but either the tail switch is getting worn or the bulb is. This particularly purchased was for a backup, I bought my first one in July of 2015, I've used it almost every day, and it is still in use currently

I was a Maglite guy for a long time, but I've found myself favoring my Streamlight flashlights since I've invested in a few.

189,R2QRDOT7O77J6G,True,I want to like this light more,"***UPDATED REVIEW 12/30/2014***

Within the past 2 weeks, this light began turning itself on in my pocket with no input from me. It burns through batteries in a day, and eventually, I begin to feel the heat against my leg. (Too late.) This disappointing light has gone in the trash, and I replaced it with a competing product that works better and cost less. Steer clear of this one. Revised my rating to 1 star.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************

I want to like this light more. Honestly, I really do. I've owned this light for 2 years, and it has been my EDC in my front left pocket every day since I bought it. Unfortunately, since day one, the light has been unreliable to turn on. I'll click the switch and nothing happens. I tap the light against something and it turns on. After that, it'll work fine until I leave it turned off for several hours, and the scenario above plays out again. The ProTac 2AAA is an awesome light otherwise, and I love the functions, size and weight. I love how it disappears in pocket and you practically forget it's there. What I don't love is the feeling of wondering if it will let you down when you need it the most.

The one issue I have is the multi-function selector switch: you only have one button to turn on the flashlight and control the brightness setting. To activate the different brightness setting, you have to quickly (.5 sec) press the button (light) on and off, which is difficult given how strong the button is. If you are intentionally trying to press the button as fast as possible, you MAY be able to get it to the correct brightness setting eventually, but it isn't something that will happen easily.

201,R2APOXKOYRN0TO,True,"Bright, big, burly.","This is bigger than I had imagined, but it is super bright. We had some cloud covered days at hunting camp so the solar panels didn’t charge the batteries. I turned on the light, sat it on its base so that it beamed against the ceiling and it lit up the entire kitchen so we could eat.

I carry this in a pocket and it is a bit big, but now that I’ve gotten used to carrying it, the size doesn’t seem that big a deal. Interestingly, I use the flashlight more than I do my pocket knife.

A quick double tap on the switch and it goes into a low setting. A triple tap and it goes into strobe.

The lugs on each side are good for standing it up. I imagine that those lugs could be handy, too, if one needs to use the flashlight as a defensive tool.

The case is tough. I had put this in my coat pocket while on a business trip to Chicago, but I found out my pocket had a hole and the flashlight dropped and hit the pavement. A couple of dings to the aluminum case, but it keeps going. When I got home, I filed down the nastiest scars so that it doesn’t snag.

The only downsides to this is battery life and the LED never goes to green when charged, but I just put it on the usb charger every evening while I sleep and I carry a pair of 18650 batteries and a charger while traveling. So long as I recharge it every couple of days it’s still operating.

A great add-on to this is a Streamlight 22100 battery charger. It comes with a pair of 18650 Li-Ion batteries. Each has a micro USB port so the battery connected to a USB transformer for recharging, or you can drop them into the charging station.",the united states,"November 15, 2019",Paul Painter,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:29:00.961673,2020-10-27 22:29:01.095485,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

202,REIKMS2X95ZC9,True,"Great value, uses rechargeable batteries, easy to use","Incredibly happy with this flashlight! I have the Protac 2LX. I’ve carried Maglights and even had a nice little Fenix model I bought for $50 5-10 years ago...

This light blows it out of the water. I haven’t had much use in the rain, but I’ve dropped it on a wood porch and it didn’t even flicker.

You can change order of the modes when you click, but honestly I’ve been using it as is. The strobe is great. The bezel doesn’t look as aggressive as some, but will still do some damage. It doesn’t snag or rip pockets.

I bought this over the Olight Striker and honestly I don’t regret it. Saved money and still got a great light. The clip can be used either way vertically and the body is about the same width top to bottom which for me was a must.

It’s light, can use 18650 rechargeable batteries, comes with 2x CR whatever camera batteries which are lasting me well. I’ll only be using 18650 when they die, though.

It comes with a thin nylon velcro holster that works on my Sam Brown or a Byron duty belt, but when it wears out I'll get a niteize holster for that.

The ten-tap programming works nicely and I've got mine programmed to come on low when the button is pressed once and high if you press it twice. I use the low setting most of the time. One nice thing about changing the batteries often is I lube the O-ring often when the light is apart.

Maybe I just lucked out. But it’s genuine.
I won’t go into all the technical flashlight geek stuff, there’s plenty of guys here that have done it much better than I ever could.
I’ll simply say that this thing is very bright. Very well made with excellent materials. Came with both a AA and a CR123 battery.
It’s as bright as 5 of my old “D” cell Maglights but it fits in my pocket!
I’ve been carrying a Streamlight Microstream in my pocket every day for years. I’ve given a few away, misplaced a few and a couple have grown legs. Never had one let me down. But when I went to use my current one the other day, I noticed that I had lost the rubber end cap. Was all set to order a new one and saw this. I was a little bit leery of the size, but I figured if worse comes to worse, I’ll put it in my truck and just get another Microstream.
It’s fine . Don’t get me wrong, it’s much larger but I carry it in my back pocket with my folded up bandanna and don’t even notice it.
The difference in brightness is incredible!
I can’t imagine a situation where it would not be sufficient. All for a great price. I’m loving mine. (Lighter is just for size reference. Everyone knows how big a Zippo is. lol)

208,R29KVK8T26GV3I,True,Makes a great car flashlight,"So I bought this with the intention of keeping it in my car. My thinking was this: I wanted something battery operated so those batteries could be swapped out with other primaries if needed in a pinch. In fact, the option to run either CR123 or AA batteries on this light is it's selling point. No need for recharging features or anything in this case.
And this fit the bill perfectly. It's a forward-clicky style meaning: a soft depress will active the first mode (350 lumens) and can be clicked into place to keep it constant. Or a quick one-two half press will take the click into the 40 lumens mode) and click into place if you want that one. The light comes on instantly with no delay. Perfect for flashing someone in the eyes or just in need of a quick burst of light without having to toggle through various modes. There is also a strobe mode. The 10-Tap programming is easy as pie and you're sure to find a ""program"" that fits the bill.

Now for the frustrating part with Streamlight and their engineering. I called them this morning because after 16 hours of charging, the indicator light never turned green to tell me it was fully charged. I assumed it was defective. I spoke with Gary who informed me that unless you use their charging head or one piece charging cable, it will not fully charge to green. I used both an Apple head and a very nice Anker head, which he said will not work to bring it to a full charge.

This is nowhere in the instructions! He is shipping me their one piece charging cable for free, but it is beyond me why they wouldn’t just include it with the light then??? I would have gladly paid $10.00 more for it to avoid the hassle of having to figure it out.

210,R13EH8D3SO76MH,True,Pro Tac HL4,"Review for Streamlight 88060 Pro Tac HL4. Great light that is extreamly bright. I can light up area approximaly half of an anchor away in complete darkness with the 2200 lumens. The two 18650 rechargable batteries and charger are a must for this light but are not included and must be purchased seperatly. It is still fairly lightweight for its size and very durable. The only downside is that it is too big for many standard flashlight holsters. I wanted to stay away from a ring because i did not want it hanging low on my duty belt. There is a custom kydex duty holster out there that you can find but it has been sold out for awhile now as they are redesigning it. I managed to get the light to fit into a size 2 bianchi flashlight holster but it is very snug and takes some effort to remove and reholster so it is only a temporary fix and not a good solution if you do not have a weapon mounted light.

211,RIDO7C0NSVQQG,True,"Great EDC item, but BE CAREFUL removing the pocket clip!","For starters the flashlight itself is superb, with the lithium battery it is very compact yet a good weight, feels good in the hand, very, very bright, the strobe light function is pretty cool and the function switching using only one button is simple to master. The carrying case is a decent size, too, and of very good quality, I like how you can slide the belt loop on or fasten it via velcro. Haven't tested out the waterproof capability but I would hope it would be decent for the price. However, if I'm totally being honest the attached pocket clip is an absolute NIGHTMARE to work with, the manufacturer should just leave it in the package unattached, you wouldn't want to carry around this premium flashlight exposed anyways and risk scratching up the lens... the manual says it's ""removable"" and other reviews say ""it pops right off"" but be careful in doing so, you can actually damage your fingers or the flashlight itself if you do not remove it correctly... the easiest, best way I've found to take off the pocket clip is to slide the flashlight, white lettering exposed (otherwise you WILL scratch the lettering off... trust me, I learned this the hard way) onto the flap of a cardboard box, say the box the item came in, and with one hand securing the flap, fingers grasping the cardboard positioned on both sides of the flashlight body, wiggle & pull the light out of the pocket clip with the other hand, firmly but at the same time carefully (you'll need to wiggle a bit instead of just pulling in order to stretch and deform the clip temporarily and free the light itself, also if you just pull the clip belt prong might just bend permanently and then would be both useless and stuck)... you will scratch off some of the black paint in doing so, it just cannot be helped... DO NOT wiggle a knife/screwdriver underneath the clamping struts unless you want to slip and stab your hand (or worse), and for goodness sakes do not use your fingernail either, the clip strut edge is pretty sharp and will cut under the nail before the clip fully releases its grip on the flashlight (again, I learned this the hard way).

212,R2MOLMZG9IVHD4,True,The HL-X is maybe 50 lumens brighter than the standard HL but with an awful clip,"I've bought 4-5 of the 750 lumen Protac HL flashlights and given them away as gifts except one that my wife keeps. I needed to order a flashlight for myself and came across the HL-X w/ 1000 lumen. Ordered one to try then maybe a second to replace my wife's 750 lumen. I fired the flashlight up and was not impressed. The brightness is barely brighter than the 750 lumen HL. Side my side the new HL-X and the old HL are exactly the same brightness but the HL-X has a slightly more defined spill border (where the light ends and darkness meets is clear and not faded). That's it. The body of the flashlight is the same as an HL, the brightness is the same as an HL, but the clip is screwed onto the frame with the HL-X but the problem is, the clip is folded in a spot were it gets in the way of removing the tail cap. The clip is weak - it wiggles easily on your pockets. It is supposed to be a dual-sided clip, but to try to make the baseball cap clip-on users happy, they ruin it for everyone else. You can get the exact same out of buying the HL and get a tighter clip.
tl;dr - Protac HL 750 is practically the same as the HL-X 1000 but the HL 750 costs a little less, has a wider light spill, and a better clip. Its not 1000 lumen - more like 800.

UPDATE - Sent back for a replacement. Received the replacement - the new HL-X I received is maybe 50 lumens brighter. This is tested in pitch black outside a city in the country.

217,RSK49NB8NQ2X3,True,Quite possibly the perfect everyday flashlight,"I just lost my ProTac 1L after 4 years of daily carry and am purchasing another, after trying out 4 other flashlights as replacements. This just might be the perfect flashlight: tough and bright enough for tactical use (my previous one saw service overseas), bright enough to do work (e.g. feeding chickens and locking the coup on a pitch black night) without being overwhelmingly brigt some some of the newer tactical lights. Dual fuel, runs forever. A truly superb product.

PROs:
(+) Solid 350 lumens as advertised
(+) Small enough to EDC without looking like ""Joe Tactical""
(+) Runs on RCR123, CR123 or any flavor of AA battery. You can find batteries anywhere (like the ""no credit cards accepted gas station in northern NH"") when your boujee rechargeable batteries run out.
(+) Excellent construction, fit and finish

CONs:
(-) Just a touch large for a single cell light...wish it was 1/3"" shorter. It is just a touch harder to pocket than true EDc lights (which in fairness are generally 14500-based).

For the price, just buy this light on Amazon, along with a couple of high-quality RCR123 batteries and a small charger (combos available for under $15) and use it into perpetuity.

218,R32NSYH79MKWUE,True,Good Flashlight that looks like it will last! Update: it did NOT last!!!,"Update:
The flashlight did not last. After only a few months with minimal use (about once or twice a week) the flashlight is no longer working. The problem started with flickering and the light jumping between the beam strengths. It also has trouble keeping a charge. Now it is so flickery and unreliable that I can not use it. I am going to call the warranty (lets hope their policy is good and replaces/fixes my flashlight). Dont waste your time or money. There has to be more reliable flashlights out there. This is unexeptible, especialy when this brand is marketed for people in high risk profesions who need reliable light.
Original Review:
I bought the Streamlight 88052 ProTac HL USB 850 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight - 850 Lumens. Every flashlight I have owned was ruined by leaky batteries, but this Streamlight has a USB charger and a concealed port for charging. I no longer have to worry about AA or AAA batteries destroying expensive flashlights. It has ten tap programming, but to activate this feature you do not click the flashlight button ten times. Instead you are suppose to press it nine times without clicking and click and hold on the tenth time. For the price this flashlight is just what I needed. I have mine programmed on low-medium-high settings with the lowest and medium being useful for household tasks and the high works great for outside tasks.",the united states,"January 22, 2020",Cassandra Lewis,1.0,0,2020-10-27 22:29:09.236387,2020-10-27 22:29:09.376014,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

220,RRWYEPGXQ5BDY,True,Very Disappointed in Streamlight.,"I've owned a few Streamlight lights over the past 40 years. And this light fit my needs almost perfectly.

Until it just up and died. I bought the light in November 2018. Today, May 27, only seven months later, it just stopped working. Now, if this got a tough beating on the road, like most of my lights when I was still touring, I'd chalk it up to the riggers of the road.

But in the seven months I've owned it, it probably doesn't have 10 hours on it. It sits on my fickin' nightstand, for Buddha sake. It's in my back pocket when I leave the house, which isn't that much. Bottom line: It gets very little use, and isn't abused. None-the-less, it just craps out on me.

222,R34ZWVWODE0W0B,True,"Well made, a little heavy for carry though. To large to mount on shogun,. Excellent for back yard who's out there...","All my other flashlights are 150 lumens which work good during power outage at home. Recently purchased 320 lumen tactical to mount on shotgun. Smaller than this model and perfect for application. This is a large and heavy flashlight, much to heavy to mount on shotgun. Trade off is portable 1,1100 lumen hand held flashlight for emergencies. Have to remember only 1 1/2 hr run time. So I purchased a couple 12 packs of batteries for storage. Took this 1,100 and my 320 lum out in out yard after dark. Wow, this one is like daylight. Then I went out front and shined this one down our street. 5 houses away is the corner which has a stop sign, which lit up like a red xmas tree! And completely lit the front of the house at end of our street that faces us. This is in town, so this morning I took it with me during my morning dog walk before sunup. This is a serious light if you are looking to light up an area. Just know that it is far from a pocket carry flashlight. But at 1,100 lumens, it is still compact enough and extremely well built. Has a vicious center beam as well. Other bonus is it was pre-set for click on high only. Great as I am not interested in the high low flicker modes. Only thing is the price is a little high. I just ordered the Steamlight Scorpion 600 lumen Tactical on Amazon $62. Will be interesting to see difference in brightness and distance.

I generally use rechargeable AA batteries in it but the option to use CR123s is nice.

225,R13IE4027N6QTR,True,Compact powerhouse that won’t empty your wallet,"So, first off, let me just say that Streamlight sets the bar for “real” flashlights. These are the ones the professionals carry. Yes, you’ll find less expensive choices out there, but they won’t hold up and perform like a Streamlight.

I own a bunch of Streamlight models and the majority are ProTac 1L-1AA’s. If you have to choose just one to flashlight to carry around, this is the one to get. It’s my favorite due to the perfect balance of size, cost and power — this model is small enough to comfortably carry, fits any budget, and is amazingly bright.

My wife and I take our dog for walks along a long, straight road near our house. With the shorter days of Fall and Winter, it’s common for us to leave at dusk and return after dark. I normally use the strobe feature of the ProTac 1L-1AA to make vehicles aware of us. The powerful beam lights up the reflective surfaces of road signs a half mile away, and oncoming traffic responds accordingly. There are definitely brighter lights in the Streamlight catalog, but they are significantly larger and require more batteries.

Speaking of batteries, I also like the “dual fuel” choice — a single CR123A or AA battery. Of course, I prefer the CR123A lithium ion cells but these are not as easy to find as the alkaline variety. In an emergency, it’s nice to have a choice.

If there is a drawback to this light, it’s the lack of support for a USB-rechargeable battery. An upgraded rechargeable model would be the perfect EDC flashlight. However, under normal use battery life is excellent, and the dual fuel capability offsets the concern.",the united states,"December 5, 2018",Topcat,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:29:15.322126,2020-10-27 22:29:15.441757,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

Don't click the tail button, just press lightly to change settings. Lanyard has a key ring on it that is a little difficut to put on but you should only have to do it once.

228,R3QPQJNUGHEUA5,True,Slightly disapoointed but I think it will be OK,"I bought this as a less-expensive alternative addition to my Fenix PD22, which I really like for a compact light but which has been discontinued in favour of a newer, more powerful - and of course more expensive - model. Fenix seem to introduce a new model every few weeks and their prices are climbing- but they do make very good lights. So these comments should be taken in context , the Streamlight being quite a bit less expensive than a comparable Fenix.

As I only recently got it I can't speak to durability but I have no reason to doubt that if it is not abused it should be pretty reliable. The body is (I think) spun aluminum, as opposed to the heavier machined tube of the Fenix lights, and this makes it feel flimsy to me. Also, there is no knurling aside from on the tailcap (to aid unscrewing for battery replacement) and this gives it a slightly slippery feel- at least to my hands. Being ""a bit older"", perhaps I have drier skin but I would have liked some knurling on the body. Two or three strips of clear or black non-slip tape may recify this but shouldn't really be necessary, IMHO.

The light temperature is good- neutral white, without the bluish cast that some lights used to have. It is worth reminding potential purchasers that it only achieves 350 L when powered by a CR123 battery, which provides 3V. With a nominal 1.5V AA, it is rated at 150L. CR123s have very long shef lives though and so are worth the extra cost. It's not a bad thing that it can take an AA in a pinch, evem if the output is reduced. And I was pleased that the included AA is an Eveready, rather than some miscellaneous brand of possibly dubious quallity.

The multiple-tap sequence to access strobe or reduced output seemed a bit fussy at first but works fine when you get used to it. Depressing the tailcap button results in full output; a short press + hold gives strobe @ full output, and two short presses + hold results in reduced output. (The printed instructions are slightly different but this is what works on my light!) However the ""tap 9 times at less than 0.4 sec. intervals"" to program a couple of alternatives seems to me to not be worth the bother.

All inall, I think it will be a good light but I must admit to being a bit disappointed with the build quality even at this price.

234,R2SGM6SOG0PRTL,True,"Great pocket light for self defense, especially if you're also carrying a gun. The button set up on this light make it perfect.","I have several different pocket flashlights in this style but this is the light that I carry everyday. The primary reason I carry this light over others is the function of the tail switch. This light comes on at full brightness when you push the button, every time. It doesn't have memory like other lights I have tried where it cycles through 2 or 3 modes with each full press and you have to go through all the modes to get back to the beginning. This light does have 3 modes but to get to them you simply depress the button halfway and then sort of tap your way through the modes until you get the one you want, after which you fully depress the button. This is important to me because I carry this light as a companion to my handgun and if I ever need to use it I want it to come on at full brightness, not soft and definitely not strobe, as could easily happen with other lights that you have to cycle through. It is very bright for it's size and the battery life is good. I use it on a daily basis, almost always for short duration, and I probably replace the batteries every other month. The light is still working acceptably when I replace them but I like to have it at full brightness and like all led lights this will keep working for a long time at a diminished brightness level.",the united states,"December 28, 2015",N.

235,R78JEY9TE45UV,True,VERY BRIGHT !!!!,"I bought the non rechargeable model. This is VERY bright and can cause eye damage if pointed directly into someone's eyes. I saw stars for approximately 15 seconds when I caught the reflection off a wall from 10 feet away. That could be advantageous if you shine the light directly into an intruders eyes as a defense but if you catch a reflection of the light it will most likely have the same effect on you.
Myself and someone else were unable to program the light and since I mainly use the low setting it's annoying having to go through the first two modes to reach the low setting every time turning the light on.
VERY Bright wide field on high and dimmer yet still bright wide field on low. High setting throws off a lot of heat making me wonder the longevity of the LED.
The clip could be better sized and then sturdier for a 1 1/2 "" belt. The sheath belt opening is velcro and adjustable and of adequate construction.

This particular light fits my kit a bit better than it's smaller brother due to the flared lens end, and it also makes it easier to pick up and use in the dark. It seems sturdy enough and hopefully will hold up as well as the others I have.

237,R19JK9XL6J2RB2,True,"overall, great light.","For a while I knew I needed a good reliable light that was waterproof, drop resistant, and most of all bright. This flashlight hit the mark for me. It features a high strobe and low setting. At first I was hesitant because I favored the mid setting of most flashlights, but then I figured the lows setting is plenty for basically any activity close range. The high setting is intense, awesome really. The beam reaches distances that will honestly compete with 1000 lumen flashlights...I often think Streamlight underestimated the high settings capability, because its darn bright. The strobe I find handy for diorienting house intruders, or just simply getting somones attention.
If you are curious about the reliablilty of its water resistance, you can rest any concern over it; I played with this thing in a 7' deep pool for about an hour and a half on vacation, stayed dry as a bone on the inside, still works perfectly!
You can tail stand this flashlight, however my only problem is that after a while the light, when on high, heats the light itself, expanding the rubber tail switch which pushes the light off of its tail end, making it incapable of tail standing unless you keep the light cool by some external effect. However on low or strobe it will be fine for as long as you need it. Not a big deal though. The light will heat up when used big high for a period of time (what light wouldn't?). At least you can keep your hands warm in the winter. The heat won't harm the light.
Ive dropped this light mulitple times and its gotten a bit tattered, which makes it look cool in my opinion, but the light has never decreased its value in anyway.
I've heard a lot of complaints about the pocket clip. But when I first recieved it, i had no clue what the complainers were talking about, as it tales a considerable amount of force to rip that thing off; its a VERY sturdy clip. if it is loose, just bend the two clamps in and snap it on...it wont fall off.
It has flat edges to prevent rolling...but they really do no good when the light gets bumped, but the clip will keep it from rolling.
This light is a magnificant EDC light. I carry it every day, and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great light for whatever reason. Ultra bright, ultra reliable, ultra water-resistant; awesome. The beam is beautiful, very defined.

I have flashlights from all the major companies (surefire, HDS, Armytek, Fenix, jetbeam, klarus, olight, thrunite, you name it and I have it). I found out that this is the best (AA,cr123) flashlight that i can use at work (IT field). simple interface, bright enough for AA battery, durable, and priced well. pretty simple to operate and you don't mistakenly end up with a different brightness. I give my flashlights to my coworkers sometimes and I don't have to explain to them how to operate it like my other flashlights. The battery last pretty good on it (about 2 weeks for my use ). I don't usually use the cr123 battery with it. I just keep some for emergency use if i run out of aa batteries. I do have other flashlights from other manufacturers that take both AA and cr123 batteries but i can clearly say that this one is the winner because I don't have to remove any parts from the flashlight when i want to use a different battery.

This one has a neat clip that will clip both ways. Clip it to your pocket then mount it on your cap. The beam pattern is a good all around balance for distance and peripheral views. No focus, don't need it and one less thing to mess up in a critical situation. Best of all it will run on an AA OR a 123A battery. The AA feature looses about 1/2 the output power, but gives the light a universal power source for backup. Construction seems fine. The programming works, just tap quickly. I like the low/high program. Thought I wouldn't like low before high but on high flashing the light in a close area zaps my night vision. Low is about what you'd expect for a close quarters tactical. The bright setting is more a mini spot light. Good for SAR work out to 50 yds or so. Plenty good for signaling and useful for spotting maybe to a hundred yards in good conditions.

You can find the AA battery almost anywhere in the world, so you do not have to worry about carrying a pile of batteries when traveling, and you can go extra bright with the 123 battery, which has a very long shelf life for a light you may leave in a purse, briefcase, or backpack for extended periods and still find useful when called upon.

256,RC397TY2GB50Y,True,"High output, very rugged and small enough to carry withyou","This flashlight is exactly what I wanted - I durable, high output light that fits in my pocket. Most other lights with this much output have a much larger bezel, which makes them too fat to carry. This light is the same diameter end-to-end. The button is programmable, so you can make it momentary high beam and push through to keep it on. I really like to be able to press and hold, or press harder and turn it on. The on/off does click, so if you want it to be silent you just hold. The button is recessed so it won't accidentally turn on. The switch seems well made with no ""mush"".

Battery life seems ok. If you leave the light on for a few minutes it does get warm around the LED. I'm still on original battery set (it takes 2) but it is rated for 3.5hrs and I haven't used it that long yet. Even after being on for 2 mins, the light level did not drop or fade.

Wipes clean from dust, dirty and grime. The lens is recessed and protected.

257,R1KD1HULJF4C1I,True,Decent light,"This is a decent light. It is bright, and i like the s-clip which lets me clip it on my hat, even tho its a little heavy for that.

Comparing this to my streamlight stinger that i bought a few years ago, and the streamlight strion that i use at work, this light is a little disappointing. its heavy for its size, and its got a warm white led, compared to my streamlight, olight, maglight and fenix flashlights which all have a cool white led. Also, the ""Ten Tap Programming"" is not nearly as easy to use as the system on the stinger and strion lights. I'm not sure i will buy anymore of streamlight's lower end lights as its just not the same build quality as the higher end stinger and strion lights.

Over all, im disappointed in this light. One good thing about it was i could buy the light only (since i already had some 18650 lithium cells), which cost half as much as getting the light + battery.

That happened pretty quickly after I bought it. It's not very durable so I have to keep it in my pocket so that it doesn't fall out some how if I hang it on my belt. There is not much warning when the battery power is about to die. When it starts acting weird, it's going to die, there is no 10-30 minutes of dimmer light, it just goes dead real soon.

I wish I took pictures! I have a lingsfire 350L green huntjng light that reaches about 350 yards. This ProTac HL3 blows it out of the water. Its many times brighter then that light. Seems to be every bit of 1100 lumen. All my other lights can't compare. It gets warm with prolonged use. It is waterproof because I dropped it in the river on the shoreline and it still functions. The whole design and quality is way higher then the other lights I have. The caps thread on nice and smooth the button functions very well. I didn't exactly time it but the Duracell 123 batteries it came with lasted the entire weekend camping and I used it a lot. Half of the time was just playing with it because it's so amazingly bright. I used my range finder to prove the distance it went, it may go father but that was just the distance across the river. The strobe setting would disorient your local thief very well.

More than bright enough for its size, navigating its 3 modes with the depressible button is super easy.

Principle issue I have is you need to hold down the button. There is no switch as it were, you hold the button to get light. Given how the modes cycle this can mean if you are shifting grip and trying to use the low light triple clicking allot.

Given that issue this could kill the light for a lot of people. I do however find it to be nice that its impossible for this thing to get switched on in your pocket and drain its own battery.

272,RMZISPH4SQREV,True,GREAT LIGHT,"I think we all know who makes the gold standard of flashlight. That being said, this is a solid light that is in a category that others neglect. Not everyone carries a big ol' 1,000 lumen light all the time. I do now but this was the light that got me into EDC lights. Cheap, durable(i've beaten the crud out of mine), battery life is pretty good, and when the battery dies in a pinch AA works fine. Lose a little brightness on AA tho. Now couple things of advice. This is not and isn't intended to be a replacement for the sun that being said I did use it once in a situation where someone was just unhappy and the light did work in getting them to go play somewhere else. Also, it is ideal to use CR123 unless in a pinch. AA battery long term does put enough pressure on the spring inside that a CR123 will no longer work.

You can go to various sites to learn about the beam distance and spill and all that stuff, but this will really light up a good sized room (12-16) is no problem for this guy. And the lumen power is plenty for household indoor use. In fact, if you have light colored walls, it may be too bright for use with eyes just waking up in the middle of the night. The build is quality and it's durable. The only 2 things I would change, to make it perfect for my use would be remove the crenellated tail cap area.

Its been a lifesaver on so many occasions to where either my phone was either dead or dying and I needed a light. The slim form allows me to carry it comfortably everywhere as it doesn't feel awkward when I'm sitting in a car or hiking a trail. The durability of the construction of the flashlight is top notch as well; its survived getting crushed against concrete and falling 20-something feet on to rocks and sticks works like a charm. As for the brightness... it out-performs most of its larger competitors. Saying its 80 lumens is being far too humble as its twice as bright as my other flashlights that claim to be 1000 lumens. I also own the Streamlight 66118 but it lacked the overall toughness to be part of my EDC.

277,R2QA4QD24GYAXB,True,Pick your battles: Cree (price) vs. Streamlight (purpose),"""Apples to Apples""

I figured many people looking at this product have or are also considering the very inexpensive Cree 7W 300LM Mini LED Flashlight (which I've also purchased and reviewed), so here's my comparison of both and also why I chose the 88031 model with 2 CR123A's over the models that use a single CR123A, AA, or AAA batteries...

Cree 7W 300LM Mini LED Flashlight:
---First glance...You notice the low price (I'll get to in a minute) and secondly you see around 1000 reviews with 90% of people giving either 5 stars or 1 star with very few in the middle.
---Reviews -whether good or bad, are all seemingly based on 2 things. 5 stars= they received an ACTUAL Cree, not a knock-off, and came from a distributor in the USA. I ordered 2 which I manually selected (for an extra .40 cents) to come from a US distributor called ""Welltop"". So they arrived in 3 days and were marked with the legit ""Cree"" as it should be on the side. 1 star= either received knock-off P.O.S's or ordered from a Hong Kong distributor taking 3-4 weeks, either way a hassle and waste of money.
---Quality (if made by Cree) well... the price should say a lot. Provided you dish out the extra $ for the UltraFire 14500 1200mah 3.6V Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery (Pair) + Charger Combo -also from Welltop- then they work well and are insanely bright. That's about where it ends... They are not shock or water resistant, so don't mount one on a firearm, and will tend to get very hot as you drain the battery which lasts about 90 minutes on ""high"". This like the Streamlight also has High, Low, and Strobe -a very slow strobe, so carry the back up battery or after that initial power burst it settles at the same brightness a cheap incondescent bulb has.
---Overall: A good price and purchase idea using them for similar things as I now do (i.e. letting the dog out, one by the night stand, if the kids need one to play with, etc...). Simply put, NOT a reliable emergency, hard worker's, LEO or tactical flashlight.
*************************
Streamlight 88031 Protac Tactical Flashlight 2L with White LED Includes 2 CR123A Lithium Batteries:
---First glance ...Okay, a bit pricey, but over 1000 reviews with 95% being 5 stars. Which do I choose and what's the catch?
---Reviews Just like Streamlight's reputation and other products, consistantly excellent and very accurate. There are bound to be some shipping mistakes or minor defects when tens of thousands are sold, but there's a reason people choose to ""exchange"" for anothr and not ""return"" for a refund. Read other reviews, just as they say -if I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Some have a problem with the ""High, Strobe, Low"" order, but it's logical with you want the strobe to use the brightest light setting which precedes it. And this is a REAL strobe... as in give the bad guy a seizure strobe.
---Quality -where your price difference is. Streamlight (unlike some other makers ""cough...Surefire...cough""), does not tack on any extra zeroes for a brand name. This price is all product, and coming from a guy who first bought the Cree, can honestly say this flashlight is worth double what Streamlight is charging. Here's why I bought 2 more after my first. This has been submeged in mud puddles, mounted and fired on both my 12ga shotgun & AR15 (5.56 NATO), chewed on by my dog, left in freezing cars and on burning hot barrels, dropped about 389 ti... 390 times, and right now is in my pocket working perfectly -aside from some cosmetic damage, but this ain't a beauty contest (though new out of the box would win). The other 2 I bought are mounted on those firearms, which being so nice and slim only required wrapping electrical tape around it to the point of needed thickness (also needed with the Cree if you put it on, ummm an airsoft gun).
---Overall this little guy is a beast worth more than you'll pay. I use this on weapons, keep one on me, and will be buying at least 2 more for emergencies (one for the car & one by the fire extinguisher in the kitchen). It not only handles everything the Cree does, but also I would recommend for workers, LEO/tactical and emergency uses... or simply to have 1 ""trusted"" flashlight in your home.

The winner (in all categories): Streamlight

The model? I chose the 88031 2L model based on simple industry logic... Companies are producing fewer AA & AAA batteries due to their short life-span, thus raising the price. CR123A's are the new go-to battery and are dropping in price daily. They hold their charge for a decade and a single CR123A puts out the same power of 2 AA's and but lasts twice as long, so you do the math. FYI, this comes with 2 brand new Duracell CR123A's that won't ""dim"" out like regular alkaline, both you and the flashlight will know when it needs new batteries. And just like AA & AAA you can get rechargable (not recommended). Size-wise, the larger 2L (instead of the much shorter 1L) IMO is more easily handled for ""regular to large"" hands or mounting on weapons.",the united states,"December 24, 2013",SteveO,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:29:35.780762,2020-10-27 22:29:35.903948,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

This sucker throws a lot of light and doesn't get as hot as some of my other lights that only put out 200 lumen on cr123 batteries.

You cycle modes by half clicks, within 0.4 seconds of each other and then press on at the setting you want.
You can also customize your stock settings to either Strobe-High or Low-High. I chose the latter.
To customize you need to, from off, press quickly in succession (within 0.4 sec of each click) press 9 times fast and stop on the 10th time until the light goes out and in the action click the trail cap button. Note: this is explained in detail in the enclosed material.

281,R2E66VPIJFBWVQ,True,Excellent product but larger than necessary,Streamlight is my favorite flashlight maker and has been for over a decade. This one is excellent as expected except I have a few design changes I’d make. The barrel is too smooth so I’d prefer something with more tactile feel. Most importantly this is much larger than the non-USB version of the same it was supposed to replace. I use a light daily around the house and shop and while taking the dog out for walks in the dark. This was just too large for my taste so I sent it back. Sadly I couldn’t find a USB rechargeable light from Streamlight that was the right size and output so I ended up buying an Olight to try out.

282,RFFWSKM27CR97,True,A whole lot of a little bitty flashlight.,"The 150 lumens is pretty comparable to the low setting on my Stinger on low. Marked difference on high with the CR123a battery. I am fairly certain that the 350 lumen setting would burn a retina out at 10 meters or less. It is very cold, bright light at 350. I really like that I can program the default on mode, as the 40 lumen mode is more than enough for most flashlight work. This light exceeds my expectations in all areas, except that of a super piercing center beam thrower light. That said, I will probably buy more of these, as 99% of the time, this light throws just fine, is super lightweight (to me), and the option of using AA's , which I use the most of, just makes it that much more useful to me.

287,R2S61GU6XYWE6G,True,This light is exactly what you seek.,"I love this light. It is everything I want in a flashlight.

At the outset, I wasn't sure about Streamlight, I thought they were an LE/GOV designer product. I bought a Surefire second hand to see what that was all about. I used it til the batteries died. Then, harshly out of character for me, I bought a TLR1 HL. The heavens opened up, and i saw a blinding light- over 600 lumens emerged from a flashlight smaller than a pack of cigarettes. At that point I was Team Streamlight. I told all my friends, tried it on two handguns, it was just what i was looking for.

After the anticlimactic Nitecore I purchased, I was wary. I made sure to read all the details, especially about batteries. This HL3 had a wider focal plane, slightly more length, and an extra 100 lumens over the other one. Those 1100 lumens blaze too. I drove my Jeep with 8k lamps into a field and shined them onto a barn a ways off, and i could see the outline of the barn against the night sky. I lit that barn up with this Wonder Wand, and i could almost see the spirits of dead farmers rising up from the ground.

The description of this product says three 123 batteries are included, and by golly, they are. Also included is a belt clip, velcro holster, and instructions on how to change lighting settings, (high, low, strobe). IF I needed another flashlight down the road, I would buy this one again, no question.

288,RBQSBGKWJZ8C3,True,"Works with EITHER a CR123 battery OR AA battery, how cool is that?!? All flashlights should do that!","Streamlight flashlights are great and this is my 3rd one. I got it because it can use 2 different types of batteries which is a huge benefit if you're out of CR123 batteries, but everyone has AA batteries laying around so this can use 1 of those as well! The CR123 battery is obviously brighter than a AA battery since it's power outbut is greater. My rough estimation would be about 33% brighter, but a AA battery is still plenty bright enough for me. I haven't tested it's runtime capabilities with both types of batteries yet, but being able to use a AA battery as a backup when the CR123 battery dies is a life-saver.

289,R3FXEJ0IU5ZZ5A,True,Perfect for EDC,"I love this flashlight! I've yet to find a competitor to it with this price point. It goes with me absolutely everywhere, and it gets far more use than I ever thought. Once you add this to your EDC, you'll wonder how you lived without it. Sure, a phone light can work in a pinch. But having a dedicated, quality light is vital. If you're looking for a great mid to high end light, this is the one.

The only cons to it are: its battery life, and it heats up if you have it on more than about 8 minutes. Both of these are minor though so I only removed 1 star.

They are denser and tougher than any other off-brand flashlight, and they also prove to be stronger and cheaper than the Surefires. Surefires are, to me, like Bose. You're paying for the name and not much more. This, though, for 75% of the price, is twice as bright as the Surefire, tougher body, and glass that's twice as thick. I scratched my Surefire glass in no time, while the Streamlight is going strongly scratch-free for almost a year of everyday carrying. The only downsides is that the default brightness is full.

292,R2BYLGCF3SVRIR,True,Fantastic flashlight for the price,"Short version: great flashlight; would recommend it and would buy again for non-emergency situations. Also, the description is wrong in that you do not need two CR123 batteries to operate. You only need one

The difference in lumens between the AA and CR123 is noticeable, but that's what you get when you go from 1.5V (AA) to 3.0V (CR123).

Where it lost a star was in the performance one night when I needed it for extended use. I was in a raining environment and had the flashlight going for a little over an hour on ""low"" mode, and when I had power cycled the light it was having difficulties coming back on again. After about 10 seconds or so and a couple of tries, the light came back on. I was running off of a AA battery at the time. I'm not sure if it was an overheating problem or a moisture problem. Either way, there is that small chance that it might not work depending on the environmental conditions, and because of that, I would not rely on this in emergency situations.

295,R1SF7OZIJDR7OH,True,A nice small light that is worth the cost,"I have had a couple of $20 flashlights and the on off button wouldn't always turn the light on and finally died completely. You basically could not count on it working when you needed it.

I decided to spend a little more and hopefully get a better quality flashlight and I believe I have. I really think the push button is going to last on this one. It just feels more positive. Light press for momentary and firm press to turn it on,

I never cared for the strobe and this light lets you select a program that is either just on high or on low and press again for high. I chose the second one and could not be happier. It took me awhile to actually get the program to change because I was trying to push the button to on instead of just momentary.

I also wanted to be able to use just regular AA batteries. I think the included CR battery is a little brighter but the AA is fine for me. The light is small. It comes with a velcro belt holster and the clip which probably can be taken off would work on a belt and will also keep it from rolling if you put it down.

There is a small hole on the base and I used the lanyard from one of my failed lights so I am set. It is a fixed beam so no focus which is fine for me.

I have the opportunity to buy these types of products heavily discounted as a firefighter and military, but I've bought all 3 of my streamlight flash lights off amazon to get them quicker... completely worth the money.

I managed the find the victim in minutes from a far when the rest of my crew was off with their lights straining to see 5 feet in front off them. The down side is it'll reflect heavily off glass and up close it's too bright. On that note, I could see how it could be good for clearing rooms or attaching to a weapon- haven't tried though.

297,R3P34RAN2W8T2O,True,"Better power regulation than the Stylus Pro, lame beam","At first glance, the numbers are unimpressive. Somewhat brighter, but a fraction of the running time. The reason is that this flashlight actually has some voltage regulation and maintains most of its brightness for a while, whereas the Stylus Pro has no power regulation and begins losing brightness immediately, trailing off at less than half output for most of the claimed running time. Streamlight has charts on the back of the packages and online.

The beam has rings. Both the distracting peripheral rings outside the flood area, and also something resembling the old ""cree ring"" just around the spot beam.

300,R1C4T0FSNR66DA,True,(Not as) Disappointed after spending so much... (See edit),"~~~Edit... Adding this statement and now increasing to four stars. I will leave my critical review below however, just FYI.
For whatever reason, it finally let me reprogram it and it works fine again.
For those of you poor saps that might have lost your instructions, to reset or reprogram the light you need to press the button 9 times in a row (fairly quickly and not pushing it in all the way / not 'clicking' it) and then on the tenth, fully depress or click and hold it in. It will give you a quick visual indicator if you did it right.
For whatever reason, mine was frozen on ""high beam only"" mode but it finally let me reprogram it. Read on for original review but my issue has finally been resolved.~~~

This is for the 88040 ProTac 750 lumens model (and I'll keep it short).
I am a fire marshal and code inspector so I have a great need for a good flashlight. Well, after only using this puppy for two months, it quit functioning as it was meant to. It now no longer has low beam mode or the strobe mode... Only high (or bright) beam all the time. When the batteries are nearing the end it appears to be in low mode for the last half hour or so of battery life but it's not like I can choose it. -- If I could, I would select 'low' mode more often to save batteries because with it stuck on high it obviously drains power rapidly. It also gets pretty hot if you have on for a minute straight or longer.
I wonder if that's how I fried it. ?? I was doing a walkthrough of a huge new building (doing an 'above ceiling' inspection) and of course, I was the only guy smart enough to bring a flashlight.
Anyway, I'm giving it two stars since it still works. It's just a battery drainer that will burn your ass if you leave it on too long.

In case you are wondering... I bought this in 12-2015 and it is now 6-2016 and I am on the verge of ordering another batch (dozen?) of Streamlight flashlight batteries. You might stretch them longer as a daily flashlight user if your 'low mode' doesn't break. -- Along with more batteries, I will be ordering another flashlight.

301,R284Z3GOANRVOI,True,Great well-designed flashlight,"---INITIAL IMPRESSIONS---
So far I'm very impressed with this flashlight. It feels very solid (all metal construction). Having the ability to recharge this flashlight through the built-in micro-USB port is really nice. There is no worrying about burning through batteries. The included cigarette lighter USB adapter is a nice bonus as well.

---USB Charging---
The USB charging port is exposed by sliding down the part of the flashlight below the lens (but above the belt clip). When the USB port is covered back up, this sliding piece slides over a gasket to keep water out. When it's closed it feels very solid and secure. Inside the 74175 rechargeable battery appears to be replaceable with an 18650 battery - so it should work fine if you had to use it with CR123A batteries (though I haven't tried this). There is an indicator light that's red while it's charging and turns green when it's charged. Mine came with the battery completely dead - it took several hours of charging before I could use it. For some reason when I was trying to first charge it the red light didn't want to come on and the flashlight wouldn't turn on even after being plugged in for several minutes (I thought it was broken) - after being plugged in for about 15 minutes however the red light turned on and it continued to charge. Maybe the battery was just really dead. Also I've noticed that when the battery gets too low the flashlight seems to just shut off rather than getting dimmer over time.

---OPERATION---
I also like how the flashlight operates. Unlike other tactical flashlights I've had that cycle through the modes with each press of the button, this flashlight always cycles between on (full power) and off with each full button press. To activate the strobe feature, you quickly half press the button before fully clicking it. To activate the low power mode, half press the button twice before fully clicking it. While this procedure took a little bit of time to get the hang of, it becomes second nature pretty quickly. I rarely find myself accidently turning it on to the wrong mode. The operation I described above is the flashlight's default programming - but apparently the flashlight can be set so that one press is low power mode, half a press then a full press is medium power, and two half-presses then a full press is full power mode. Also the flashlight can be programmed so that only full power mode can be activated to avoid accidently activating other modes I assume.

---PERFORMANCE---
The high lumen output is the main reason why I wanted this flashlight. At first when I turned it on indoors it was bright, but it wasn't until I used it outdoors that this flashlight was really impressive. It's really great for lighting up large areas outside. I was impressed at how well it lit up everything while shining it across a parking lot. Though it isn't adjustable, I liked the focus of the beam. It wasn't too spread out and diffused but it wasn't too narrow either. I'd say the light itself is more yellow (warmer) than other flashlights I've used - but not as warm in color as an older style of flashlight with a filament bulb. The low-power mode is pretty dim and not something I will likely use much, but it's nice to have the option to conserve power just in case. I haven't really used the flashlight in medium power mode. Finally the strobe feature works very well. Comparing it to other strobe LED flashlights, this flashlight's strobe seems to be faster and more disorienting.",the united states,"May 6, 2016",jake,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:29:49.326711,2020-10-27 22:29:49.447992,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

305,R3QDOO1W2BN4O6,True,"Decent light, overblown expectations","Sure, it’s a 350 lumen “flash” light, but beyond the first burst, it’s at best a 200 lumen torch. It eats the CR123A cells required for the full 350 lumens, and the output chart on the back of the box (Amazon, you should have included this) shows rapid falloff toward 200 lumens the moment it’s turned on. AA loss is not as extreme; one alkaline AA is steady for just over an hour at about 125 lumens and using a lithium AA stretches that to over 4.
I paid about half-retail, and if realistically advertised as a 125 lumen light and shipped with a lithium AA, this would be a 4-star product: compact, durable, good AA throw.

309,RKLIU4CC35FHW,True,"Cheap but Effective, Could Be Improved","I actually expected this to be more of an 85/100 (4 stars going on 5) when in fact I'm going to call it a 70/100.

My point of reference for this light is the Inova T1, which is similar in many ways with a slightly different intended user in mind. Compared to the T1, I like that the Streamlight 2L is slimmer and lighter. I also like that is has a clip. My use for this light is for general purpose but also as a fighting light to go with my carry gun (which I don't carry with a mounted light). The clip makes this light much faster to deploy, since the T1 used to sit in my pocket with a number of other items. It's also small and light enough that it is basically unnoticeable when clipped in your pocket.

Brightness is definitely good (maybe even a little more than you want on a light like this) and I like that you get 3 hours of life from a set of batteries. The hue of the beam is a little blue, which is frankly a little weak since these days a good LED flashlight can be made to have a very neutral white beam. Not blue enough to be an issue, but I'd prefer if it was whiter.

The click button is perfectly adequate and I like that you have to press relatively deep to actually click it on. This makes it easy to use as a temporary-on light. Strobe mode is also easy to activate without being cumbersome. Strobe mode is a double click and low mode is a triple click. Low mode is a pain to get into but that's fine because it's really only for if you plan to have the light on for an extended period and don't want to deplete the batteries.

What I don't like...

It's cheap. Nothing here really feels highly robust or durable. It doesn't feel like it will fall apart, but if I didn't work a white collar job and do car camping as my most intense outdoor activity, I wouldn't trust it. For my purposes I'm sure it will be fine. In general I trust Streamlight and have two of their TLR-1 weapon light (which I love and it is very robust). That said if I worked a blue collar job or needed this for duty purposes or intense outdoor activity, I'd say to look at Surefire. My Inova T1 is definitely much more of a quality item, but it is also larger and probably twice as heavy, and definitely not as tactical in design.

The finish on the light is pretty smooth, aside from the features on it, so wet grip will probably score a C-.

The spill of the light isn't as wide as I'd like in a tactical light, but it's not bad. The spill area is good as far as brightness, just not width.

Finally the clip design is poor. Stiffness is great but the way it's set up, your pants fabric will catch before getting up into the top of the clip unless you really work at it. Not conducive to putting the light back in your pocket and clipping it one-handed. I removed the clip and bent it with pliers to make it so it stopped snagging and still has proper tension. Not the end of the world, but I prefer when I don't have to modify a product to make it optimal.

I have no qualms about using this as my EDC light, but if I had $200+ to spend on an EDC light I'd probably get a Surefire... but I don't so this will work well.",the united states,"March 6, 2014",Zach B.,3.0,0,2020-10-27 22:29:50.371383,2020-10-27 22:29:50.498098,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

310,R3BMGCAGU7UMWZ,True,"The Streamlight ProTac 2L-X: Simple, Practical, Excellent","The ProTac 2L-X has quickly become my favorite flashlight. The machining quality, anodization, and general fit and finish are all excellent. You can tell that it's quality as soon as you pick it up. The tail switch has longer travel than other lights, and this makes it much easier to use the momentary function to cycle through modes without accidentally clicking it on at a brightness level you don't want. Programming is relatively easy with clear instructions, and once you have it on the configuration that you want, it's a breeze to operate. I have mine on Low-High for simplicity and EDC usage. The light tailstands easily, and the clip is excellent. This is the first 18650-sized light that I can comfortably carry in my pocket because of how deep the clip is. You can actually put it on a baseball cap too, although it looks pretty ridiculous because of the size. I find the light output to be adequate and the runtimes to be excellent. No, it does not put out as many lumens as comparably-sized lights, but it delivers almost as much but with much longer runtimes*. I personally find this to be much more useful. Some 1000 lumen lights will throw light farther than I can clearly see, and they burn through batteries like crazy. This light shines plenty far but is much more efficient with its runtimes. My only real complaint is the color of the light. It's not cool white like most LEDs, but it's not really neutral white either - it's more of a yellowish tint. This is a really minor complaint as I can still see everything just fine, it just distorts certain colors a little bit. Overall, the ProTac 2L-X is excellent, and if you are considering a purchase then you won't be disappointed.

You have to press it all the way down like to the body of the flashlight, which feels like about a 1/4 inch before it clicks. And the actual mechanism that “clicks” under the rubber is just a very small pin-point you can feel under the actual button. Using a CR123 battery, the light does produce decent light. However, it seams all over the place. It doesn’t have great throw and the spill is broken and un-even. Using a single AA battery, this flashlight doesn’t stand out of the crowd. It’s ok at best.

323,R18GJF8SJT0TB9,True,"Overall fantastic, only a couple things I would change","I just received my light, so this is really just a preliminary review.

First thing I noticed, how compact it is! This is probably the only 2x CR123 light that I would EDC (everyday carry). Most other flashlights have a large head that make it cumbersome to carry. This one fits nicely in my left back pocket, almost unnoticeable if you are used to carrying flashlights or knives.

The beam is great. High mode is very bright. I'm used to carrying a Surefire E1B backup, which cost me $140. This light seems brighter. I can't do a side-by-side comparison because I lost the Surefire, hence why I bought this. Granted, the Surefire was a single cell, and this is a 2 cell, but it's worth noting.

The programming modes are awesome! I really, REALLY hate flashlights that have a million different modes. I only want two modes, low and high. I don't need strobe, SOS, or any other fancy modes. This flashlight allows me to program it how I want it. I was worried about this at first, because I thought it would be confusing to operate, or that I would accidentally switch between modes. It turns out that it's very simple to switch between the 3 modes, and nearly impossible to accidentally switch between them. One small gripe, is there is no mode for High-low. However, I can live with the Low-high mode.

Another small complaint I have is, the pocket clip hangs up on my jeans. I can easily slide the clip half way onto my jeans pocket, but then it hangs up. I have to pull outward on the clip to get it to ""seat"" all the way. I ended up slightly prying to clip outward to make it a little easier, however it still binds up a little because of the design, and it seems like it will chew up my jeans over time. It's the part that clips onto the flashlight that binds on the pocket, because it has a sharp 90 degree edge. Chamfering that edge with a file will probably remedy that problem.

This light is OK. It is my second of this type, and this one seems to be dimmer than my original light. Here's what you need to know. I do not doubt it is the full 850 lumens, it's bright at very close range. However, the beam pattern is very wide and the brightness of the light is lost at any distance. For my use, it is adequate, but I wish the beam was more narrow so as not to shine it into the eyes of inmates when doing nightly checks. Personal issue. The rechargeable battery is nice, saving money and heartache hunting down CR123 batteries for a reasonable price. It is also nice that it takes a very common charger. BUT, it takes FOREVER to charge. Charging overnight is the only feasible option. Once it is charged, it lasts a very short time on the high setting in my opinion. The versatility is nice though. I occasionally have problems with the light not working, I will have it on and it will momentarily go out as if the end cap is loose, even if it is not. It is not common enough to be an issue for me, but it is a data point. I get a lot of compliments on this light, and am often asked how much I paid for it.

Care must be given to this light though. The thread for the top where the led is housed is not that strong. If this thread is weakened the light will not function properly that is to say the on feature will not engage. For that reason use of the included black metal holding clip is not advised.

Reasons to like the light: short length keeps it from popping out of your pocket when moving, strong beam with a good width and depth of beam coverage, strong housing (dropped way to many times to count), small enough to stay hidden, thick enough to fill your grip in a fist, dual brightness helps with admin work and car repairs so you don’t washout what you’re looking at.

I bought this light because Kyle Defoor recommended it. I have found that many of my local LEOs and shooting instructors carry one. It works.

344,R2LYTKG4IMUORM,True,Reliable But Needs Improvement,"We bought three for our family's camping bags; they all worked perfectly out of the box and feel solid and reliable. The grip is aggressive enough to provide solid control even if wet, and the gaskets were all in good working order.

The one issue I have is the multi-function selector switch: you only have one button to turn on the flashlight and control the brightness setting. To activate the different brightness setting, you have to quickly (<.5 sec) press the button (light) on and off, which is difficult given how strong the button is. If you are intentionally trying to press the button as fast as possible, you MAY be able to get it to the correct brightness setting eventually, but it isn't something that will happen easily. There is a way to reprogram the light so that the default changes from high/low to low/high, but is needlessly more difficult than cheaper lights that cycle brightness settings (low-high-off).",the united states,"April 22, 2019",Mary and Nathan,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:09.582091,2020-10-27 22:30:09.746119,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

345,R1NY950VN2U5WW,True,Nice,"Okay, I'm impressed with this little wonder light. I bought it six months ago and have been carrying it with me ever since. It's only about 3 5/16 inches long and 13/16 inch in diameter (at the bezel), and throws out a tight, bright, blinding white beam. It is high quality all the way, both in material & manufacture. Like any good daily carry item, it's not cumbersome and most of the time I'm not even aware that it's there; but when I do need it, it's available and ready to do its job. This will never replace my primary tactical flashlight--and if I was allowed to carry a firearm in my oppressive state of residence I'd surely be carrying something other than the Protac--but it's a great little gadget for an everyday carry item or backup. I was carrying a Surefire Executive Defender (E2D) until I bought this. Don't get me wrong, I didn't buy this with the specific intention of replacing my E2D (actually, I'm not sure why I bought it). I was and am still perfectly satisfied with the E2D; but the Protac is just so much easier to carry around (especially with its included nylon belt holster), has almost twice the output of the E2D (110 lumens vs 60) with a cleaner & whiter LED light versus the E2D's yellowish Xenon lamp, has a longer battery life (even on ""high""), and is more versatile with its additional ""low"" setting that I figured it was a much better choice for me (YMMV). And I gotta admit, even though I'm a big fan of the crenelated bezel on the E2D, the fact is, the crenelated bezel has put holes in my pants, something I'll never have to worry about with the Protac. [Yes, the Protac has a somewhat crenelated bezel, too, but not as aggressive and obviously a lot smaller.] I think there are better choices for a flashlight to keep stowed in the car, but this could certainly fill that role, too. All in all, an impressive little tool.

Edited To Add (Part 2) 12/10/13
-------------------------------
The above review is for the Protac 1L. This year (yesterday in fact) Amazon had a Lightning Deal on the 2L, so being as impressed as I was with the 1L, it was a no-brainer that I would purchase its big brother during the sale also. Unfortunately, Amazon won't let me make a second separate review for the 2L, so I have to piggy back my review of it onto this one (which probably means nobody will ever see it, considering the sheer number of reviews on this product).

First of all, kudos to Amazon... overnight shipping (w/o paying for it) during the Christmas rush? Wow! This is the second product in two days in which that happened. Impressive.

As for the Protac 2L, it's a solid 4-star product. I have to be more critical with the 2L because it really is more of a tactical flashlight than the 1L. Some people (not me) will not like the fact that it doesn't come with a lanyard, nor does it have a loop to attach one (though you might be able to attach one to the included clip). I also think the head is too long in relation to the body; if you use the clip to carry the light bezel up, there's too much protruding out of your pocket, so you're pretty much limited to bezel-down carry with the clip. My biggest complaint, however, is the recessed tailcap switch. A recessed switch precludes one from using the Surefire-Rogers low-light technique (i.e. the ""cigar method""), or at least from performing it correctly. This is where SureFire flashlights will never be beaten; their tailcap design (on the 6P, G2, etc) is perfect for tactical use. No ""tactical"" light should ever have a recessed tailcap switch. So again, like the 1L, the 2L will never replace my primary tactical light. It is, however, my new EDC light, replacing the 1L.

Aside from the above criticisms this is a solid, high-quality light. It's plenty bright on 'high', and 'low' is still bright enough for you to navigate around in darkness or to read things w/o burning up your batteries. The 2L has a REALLY NEAT feature that the 1L doesn't; it gives the user a choice of three preset programs. The factory default is high-strobe-low. Also available are high-only and low-high. I use the low-high mode; I'm not a fan of strobes, and even if I was I think it's pretty ridiculous to think that in a life-or-death situation, with an adrenaline dump in your body and loss of fine motor skills, that one can seamlessly perform a double-tap to activate strobe mode when a bad guy has a gun pointing down his/her throat! If I was a LEO, I think I'd keep it set on high-only while on duty; switch to low-high if there's a legitimate need for a 'low' beam. Frankly, I think Streamlight mucked that one up, too. It makes MUCH more sense to have a high-low program on a ""tactical"" light instead of a low-high program, but that option isn't available. Pretty dumb (IMO).

Everything else is as you would expect. High quality materials/workmanship, waterproof to 1m, crenelated bezel (albeit more subtle), a nice pure white light, nice throw, good beam form, etc. It's ""maybe"" kind of narrow if you have big hands, but the clip certainly aids in gripping (if you choose to keep it on). It also comes with a ballistic nylon holster, if (like me) you prefer belt carry over pocket carry. Two Duracell Ultra 123 batteries are included. Like I said, a solid 4-star product.",the united states,"May 23, 2013",JW,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:09.749801,2020-10-27 22:30:09.869354,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The modes go from High -> High Strobe -> Low, which is perfect for tactical use. A quick double-tap and hold activates the strobe mode. If you're in an environment where you'll use a single mode, you can use the ten-tap programming to make that mode stick.

The clip is useful for carrying almost anywhere, and it works both ways, so you can also clip it onto your cap.

352,R3ONAR3DCGIUC0,True,Still a good torch,"This little torch is AMAZING. I primarily wanted something to sweep the house with in the middle of the night when ""the wife hears a noise"". Anyway, this light makes a great companion to my glock during those occasions. Again, very impressed with the size, feel, and output of this light. I even tested the light on my unknowing subject ""wife"" in the dark of the night and she said the thing blinded her silly. But seriously, good torch for the costs and size. Have already recommended to friends. As a side note, I own a much larger Coleman spotlight that puts out 250 lumens and this little light blows that away by a long shot.

--UPDATE--

So, my favorite little light decided to up and die on me while looking under the hood of my car. I've literally used this thing 3 times. While using it the last time, it was used no longer than 10 minutes. The light got hot and I turned it off. It never turned back on. Very disappointed to say the least. Not sure if I got a bad unit or what but I liked it so much I'm willing to give it another shot and return this for another. Will update once I get a thorough test on the second unit. And I will test it till the battery runs out.

--UPDATE 2--

First off, Kudos to Amazon. They shipped me a new light Monday and I received it Tuesday. I immediately put the thing to test. This particular light behaved much different than the first. I left it on for over 30 minutes at one point and while it got warm, it never got as hot to the touch as the first one did. Anyway, the second light works great and I still love it.

355,RO677WCAUFLZM,True,Nice little light,"I bought this guy to replace a Polytac that I somehow managed to lose and that I was, in turn, lost without. My main light is a Streamlight Stinger but I need a small backup light that I can always carry since the Stinger is too large to wear comfortably all the time.

This light is great. Typical Streamlight quality without the ultra-premium price tag. It is VERY bright at max, the strobe is nice and disorienting, it's sturdy and feels good in your hand, and the tailcap switch feels solid.

Only a couple minor negatives:

a. It is very lightweight. Along with the light weight (I had to double check to make sure it wasn't a polymer flashlight when I first took it out of its package), it's fairly skinny...not much bigger around than the included lithium batteries. It's also a shorter light (which I wanted), and if you take it all together and it's just not a very substantial tool. Not a big deal, but I wouldn't have minded something a bit more solid.

b. The switching system. This is what I knocked a star off for. I can understand why Streamlight did what it did here, but the pattern doesn't work best for me. Click once and it comes on in high mode. Click again, and it strobes. Click a third time and it goes to low. I would have MUCH preferred it started low, then high, then strobe. It's not a deal breaker and I'll get used to it, but I really don't like it much. Also, like I mentioned above, the switch feels positive and sturdy, but it's a long-throw and clicking through that long throw 5 times to get to low-mode is mildly irritating.

c: The included pouch is pretty cheap and I'll be trying to find a molded nylon pouch to replace it. I honestly worry about the security of this light while hanging on my belt, but I've had no problems with it (other than mental ones, that is).

All that aside, it really is a great light and I'd buy it again if I had to do it over again.",the united states,"March 16, 2011",Chris O,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:15.177523,2020-10-27 22:30:15.297383,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

356,RYC30LK635KYF,True,Streamlight ProTAC 2AAA KICKS BUTT!!,"If any of you watch YouTube...look up Nutnfancy's review of this light. He says it all...
Originally, I was looking at either the Preon-1 or 2, or the Pro Stylus, and ended up seeing this one on the page for the Stylus here on Amazon... so I clicked on it and opened it up. And I am glad I did! I was looking for an EDC flashlight that was light enough to carry in my pocket every day, but wasn't going to break the bank in terms of cost, and this fits that role perfectly. I didn't want to spend more than $30 on this light because I already have an Olight M20 Warrior, and an Olight T25 which I LOVE both...but even the T25 is a little too big for EDC (at least for me). The Preon 1 is a twist top (to turn on/off) and I wanted a tailcap pushbutton, and that's why the Pro Stylus was my original choice. (I STILL may buy the Preon-1, because for only $32 bucks that thing looks like a powerhouse of a mini flashlight!) However, I ended up going with this one instead of the Pro Stylus due to the higher lumens and it has a high/low/strobe function, which the Pro Stylus does not. And in comparison to the Preon-1, this was a little bigger, and I didn't want to lose the small Preon.

And wow...this thing is awesome for such a little pkg.

Pro's (for me):
Good amount of light: 80 lumens on high, 10 on low.
Lightweight. I barely notice it's there.
O-rings for water resistance. (I think it says it's waterproof down to 3-5 meters or something like that, but I don't intend on diving with it, so that's fine.)
Good quality build.
Good price: $29 bucks on Amazon, but I've seen it for less elsewhere.
I like that it uses AAA batteries, which are readily available anywhere. (There is a AA version of this light as well, if you want a little bigger version!)

Con's:
I wish the clip was a little higher, so it rides deeper in my pocket. So I don't lose it.
The tailcap button is hard to press. But I'm finding I might like that so it doesn't accidently get turned on in my pocket or bag.
I wish it came in other colors: metallic orange, blue, green, etc. Then it's easer to find in a dark bag at night.
I wish the high/low beams were right next to each other, instead of it being: Hight (single click), Strobe (double click), and Low (triple click). Put the low before strobe! I'm sure there is some reason for that. But it's not a deal breaker by any means.

It fits in my pocket right next to my Spydeco Tenacious just fine. It's about the size of a fat sharpie pen and I barely notice it's there. In fact since I started carrying it, I have to reach down once in a while to feel if it's still there!

So here's what I did at home when I first got it. I pulled out my large Maglite, my Olight T25, and a no name Asian brand LED light I bought here on Amazon for 4 bucks (I didn't bother bringing out the M20 because that thing is a beast. I turned all the lights out in my living room and tested them by shining them on the ceiling one at a time. The Maglite and T25 have fairly new batteries, and the little LED has never been used. So the T25 was brightest, the no-name LED was dead last...and this little Streamlight beat that huge Maglite! In terms of brightness, wide beam...it killed my big maglite! I took my new ProTAC outside and shined it out to where my dogs are (about 20m) and it lit up the whole area. I don't think it throws 80m as advertised...but it sure does put out a lot of light.

If you're looking for a good quality, high lumen EDC light that won't break the bank...this IS IT. Buy it. Carry it. Love it. You'll be glad you did.

UPDATE:
Last night after a gig (I moonlight as a musician) I was walking out along the back of the hotel I was at, back to the parking lot and remembered I had my ProTAC in my pocket, so I pulled it out to test it. It was really dark, almost pitch black, and I must say, this light really lit up the entire area. So I'll take back what I said above...this light lit up a couple trash cans and boxes that were out at least 60m from where I was! I shined it down this really long maintenance pathway, and it lit the whole area. I am impressed more than I was before. If you're looking at the Pro Stylus, take a look at this light as well.

359,R2WO3G6HAX0HY0,True,Touchy Tail Switch,"Initial impressions (the first few days) of the ProTac HL 600 lumen

I bought this for my every day carry. Some people might say its too heavy or large for EDC but I think it will work well. You can see the specs online. It is slightly heaver and thicker but not as long as the LED MagLite I used to carry. If you're concerned about size then you either have to spend more money or go for less lumens. You could consider a polymer but I like the feel of metal.

It has a low lumen for regular close up work but still lights up a room very well. 600 lumen for the blinding down range sort of work. Be advised that it appears that the 600 lumens does not last 1.5 hours as suggested - the output significantly tapers down after the first few minutes.

Tail switch is way too touchy. Takes very little pressure to activate the light. This is bad for carrying in a sheath. I use a Maxpedition flashlight sheath and the light can be easily activated during every day carry or when sitting should anything press against the sheath. I easily circumvented this by putting a large bottle cap in the bottom of the sheath. The tail switch sits in the cap and cannot be activated by pressure from outside the sheath.

Speaking of sheathes, the one that came with the light is a joke. Flimsy nylon as expected but the fact that the sheath is too small for the light surprises me. The velcro hardly overlaps. No doubt the light will fall out under hard carry. Same problem with the switch as noted above would also apply. Glad I already had a sheath I trusted.

Fits well in hand. (I probably have medium sized hands, wear 7.5 sterile gloves if that helps). Seems stable even when wet. Works well with heavy extraction gloves. Pocket clip is sturdy but light will stick out of your pocket about an inch or more and you probably risk hitting the switch. Clip also has a lanyard hole. Seems too small for 550 cord but you could probably get the paracord sheath through the hole.

Its a bit awkward to switch between the settings at first (lightly press, not click, the switch for less than half a second and then press and hold on your desired setting). I feel this will take some getting used to but hasn't been a problem yet. Kind of wish it had an intermediate (perhaps even an extra low) setting.

First light I own with the TEN TAP - very cool concept but would like to see more options. Instead of the 3 it comes with: high/strobe/low, high only, low/high. Other combinations could be added: low only, strobe only, high/low; because you can change to any of these in less than a minute, more combinations would give the user more options. Adding an intermediate (maybe 200 lumens) and even an extra low setting (maybe 10 lumens) would make this light extremely versatile.

I use the low/high setting but I’ve noticed a problem. Sometimes the light starts on high instead of low. If you're not cautious you will be running on high and kill your batteries.

Overall, the last few days haven't required much use of the light but of course I’ve been manipulating and learning it. Hope to add to the review in a few months after some hard use.

Update August 2017 (purchased sept 2015)
Tail switch remains touchy. Sometimes the light flickers. Not sure why. I elongate the spring and that seems to temporarily solve the problem.

Over the months I've used it many times and still wish for an extra low setting. The low setting is near blinding for close up work and will run down the battery faster than say 10 lumens for example.

Small amount of cosmetic damage after a few drops. No big deal.

This is my EDC light but I don't use it everyday. Have only changed the batteries twice.

Overall still happy with it but given the flickering issue would have trouble trusting my life to it.",the united states,"September 29, 2015",Dave,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:15.747130,2020-10-27 22:30:15.881769,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I'd been using a 272 lumen maglite, and I found it didn't provide enough light for certain situations, and I didn't like that it wouldn't stand upright on its own very well.

The fact that it takes 18650 rechargeable batteries is nice, too. Kind of disappointing that they only give you a single 18650 for a $20 price premium.

Straight to high mode. Doubletap for strobe. With a little practice it is easy. If confronted on a dark street the deployment of the strobe within 30 feet would likely blind the subject so badly that they would stop. It could be used in the off hand as blinding/impact tool in concert with an empty or full right hand. I recently had a 60# dog push past his owner and out his front door. The combination of the strobe light and some loud yelling stopped the dog in his tracks about 20 feet away. The ability to use either source of power is great.

90% Happy Pros:
*Small and litt yet puts out some serious light
*Easy button on off button with High beam, strobe and low beam function
*Price compared to my other streamlights that are larger, longer and heavier with a higher price makes this is a winner
*Fits in my blue jean pocket easily
*Light doesn't attract bugs

10% Why i'm not at 100% (these are stupid small issues)
** I work on a tiny island in the Pacific no stores no batteries so i ship everything in 1 (once a month)
** This light eats batteries when used on High Beam and i use high beam 90% of the time
**Needs red filters and accessories.

OVERALL:

This is a replacement light to replace the one i broke so i needed a light for night duty with zero street lights, no working lights, 100% black out conditions and i can light up through the distance and can also light up a wide angle as well. Its lite weight and its easy to use and i love it which i decided to just keep this light for work and retire my other heavier, older and not so bright lights.

366,R1CIKH3E4MKMNS,True,Great Light - Reasonable Upgrade from Stylus Pro,"About the light:

I have carried the Streamlight Stylus Pro for about a year (see review) and have been extremely pleased with it. What made me change/upgrade? Several things: First, I wanted a little more power, without more size. This light meets both of those. This light may not appear to be any brighter in a room than the Stylus Pro, however at night outside, I did the tree test about 25 yards. It was noticeably brighter. Second, Nutnfancy (see Nutnfancy youtube channel) gave a wonderful review of this light in comparison to the Stylus Pro. I heavily consider his input, as he is a great gear tester/reviewer. This light also comes with a low mode and strobe, both of which I plan to use, especially the low mode. The only downside of this light compared to the Stylus Pro is battery life, the SP has 6.25hrs run time, while this ProTac AAA has 1.5hrs on high and 30hrs on low. There is give and take. The SP has great battery life, but only one mode, and isn't as bright. The PT AAA has more modes, but less battery life. I still plan to use both, and would have both.

About the tailcap switch:

Some complain about it being stiff or hard to press. I have not had that issue. It does take effort, but that is by design, so that it doesn't activate in the pocket. This is a tactical light, hence the ProTac, so it is meant to be carried, and not easily activated. That being said, unless you have arthritis you will have no problem activating this light. I'm 6'2 180, average build, don't have the strongest hands, and I have no issues at all turning this light on and off. I also find it easy to switch between the 3 modes. I do recommend putting a drop of oil, gun oil, etc. on the tail cap threads as it helps the removal a lot. Otherwise they are dry and its a metal to metal feel.

Note on batteries (from my Stylus Pro review):

I am using the Lithium batteries with the ProTac AAA also because of the following experience with alkaline in the Stylus Pro.

I recently did change from the typical Energizer alkaline batteries, to the Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for several reasons. First, I learned that lithium batteries perform better in extreme temperatures, especially in cold weather. Cold weather drains alkaline batteries. Lithium batteries are superior in every way, except in price, but they are worth it. I had a Stylus Pro several years ago, that I left in a drawer for months. I went to get it one day, and it still worked, however when I opened it up the batteries had leaked and were stuck. I tried everything to get them out, but was only able to remove one. I had to throw the light away. Alkaline batteries can and often do leak, and when they do in a tiny light like this, it ruins the light. So my suggestion is to use lithium batteries. WM and Lowes sell them, Energizer Ultimate Lithium, 4 for about $9-10.",the united states,"November 7, 2013",Sojourner,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:18.770395,2020-10-27 22:30:18.884093,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

367,RMWAWR261QU5U,True,"Good price, very bright, you will like this light","I am a flashlight guy. I have dozens of them, and I use them professionally as well as around the house. I have a lot to compare this light to, including several high quality lights from Maglight, Surefire, Streamlight, Coast, Dorcy and several cheapo brands that I have tried through the years. This light is as good as any I have had.

The ProTac HL is extremely bright, and it feels as strong and sturdy as you would expect from Streamlight. The tail switch functions smoothly and feels durable with no ""misses"".

After research, I purchased this light to be installed on a tactical rifle. It is just right for my application, because I prefer a light that can cast a wide beam far down range. This light does that. it will light up the world between you and your target, including every inch of the ground between you and your target. This relaxes your peripheral vision and allows you to be sure of what is around your target. Some like a tightly focused beam, and if that is your thing, this light may not be for you. But I can tell you that this light will give you good downrange illumination almost as good as the tightest of beams. Streamlight did not make any shortcuts here that I can see.

The price for this light seems low to me. It is an outstanding value when you compare it to other lights in its class. A 600 lumen light that is made by one of the best in the industry and has quality components for far less than you would pay for most similar lights. Amazon's price for this light is incredible.

Another positive for this light is the programmable tail switch. For a rifle application I prefer a on/off clicky cap, and this light can do that. If you prefer a series of high/low/strobe, it can do that, too. You choose the setting you want. It programs reliably and once you set it it will stay on your setting until you change it - at least mine has.

If there is any con to this light I guess you could say it is the relatively short battery life. This is probably true of most high lumen tactical flashlights, so the ProTac is not unique here. The simple truth is that you cannot get high lumens and a powerful beam without burning energy. There are some rechargeable lights out there, but you will pay handsomely for them, and I think they are over-rated based on past experiences with them.

In my opinion, you cannot go wrong for the ProTac HL, especially for the price Amazon is selling it for.

*****UPDATE 06/21/13

I should add that this light fits perfectly into the Elzetta ZFH1500 tactical flashlight mount with no modifications necessary to the mount - for those that are interested in that fact. I also recommend that mount for those looking for a tactically sound way to install a light on their AR-15.

Use it when working under a vehicle in the garage too, it is light weight enough that you can easily bite the tail cap to shine light on your work hands free. A friend of mine actually put some heavy duty shrink tube on his tail cap for this purpose. Great little light.

UPDATE:
This review unfortunately just lost two stars due to bad customer support. I cracked the lens on the light and had hopes and expectations that the lens would be able to be easily and quickly replaced without a lot of hassle. I emailed support thinking it would be as simple as asking them to send me a replacement lens cap since the part just threads onto the light. See the email thread below (start from the bottom), I've blocked out only personal information. I will update again when I finish the process with the authorized repair center.

I am now going through an authorized service center to handle this, but would like to inform you that you are making the warranty process a huge pain. If you would simply look at the image I emailed you twice (three times now), you would see that no retaining ring came loose. The cap that the lens presses into is a removable part of the light. It threads onto the light and is sealed by an o-ring. That is the part that I would have liked for you to send me. Your lack of competence on your own product and what parts are serviceable is very concerning and makes me question if your product was the right one to spend my money on. When I spoke to the service center, they immediately knew what I was talking about. Pick your head up from your script and go look at the product before you reply to service inquiries.

372,R1K55KKTX3E7BE,True,Best EDC flashlight,"This review applies to the 2L version of the flashlight. I've been carrying this one for about a year. It is by far the brightest flashlight I can tolerate for EDC. I have brighter flashlights, but they just don't fit in my pockets comfortably. So they stay at home and are rarely at hand when I need them.

This one is pretty bright--it certainly straddles the threshold as a 'tactical' light. But to be totally honest, I haven't yet had to blind any gunmen or bash in any terrorist brains with this light. I can't guarantee it's up to that task. But what amazed me when I started carrying this thing was the tremendous non-tactical utility of carrying a bright flashlight all the time: Tracing cables. Finding that screw I dropped. Changing a tire at night. Flagging folks down. Tripping that occupancy sensor. Pointing things out to a contractor. Startling whatever's rummaging through the trash at night... the list goes on.

I do hope someday to find a brighter and/or smaller flashlight to replace this one before it wears out. But for now, this one has proven entirely suitable for EDC, and I'll never find my cellphone's flashlight-mode adequate again. The clip is just right for in-pocket carry (tailbutton up). Mine works perfectly after a year's use, although it looks quite beat up. My only complaint: I wish the tailbutton were more difficult to press, or further recessed. On several occasions I've accidentally clicked the light on in my pocket, and not noticed until it's scalding hot (and depleted the batteries). The batteries are not cheap; for me they last at most a month (and that's without draining them in my pocket), but their cost is entirely justified by the performance of the light.",the united states,"May 14, 2014",idiotmike,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:22.715180,2020-10-27 22:30:22.839660,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

373,RVK1513D2ZY9X,True,"Great, Full-Featured Light, One Flaw","The Streamlight ProTac 2L is a great flashlight for just about every purpose. I like it's size, 4.75"" long and 13/16"" in diameter. The power is very adequate at 260 Lumens (full charge) and up to 200 L for 2.5 hrs. according to Streamlight's Product Fact Sheet. The tail cap switch is recommended for use with a firearm as is the momentary function provided when the switch is lightly depressed. This light offers several different combinations of functions which can be set by following instructions and using the switch. The basic functions are high beam, low beam and strobe. It takes some practice to make the use second nature, but the three functions make this light very useful in a variety of conditions some of which could be life threatening. It comes with a pocket clip with strong tension which can secure the light in pockets or on a strap or belt up to 1.5"" wide. It also comes with a sturdy belt pouch.

The only downside to this light is that there is no texture to the outer finish. It is very smooth. This means when pressing the switch with the thumb with dry or wet hands, the light is prone to sliding forward in the hand rather than actually operating the light. Not a good thing if your safety or that of others depends on it. I otherwise like the light well enough to keep it, but will definitely have to use something to give the exterior a no-slip texture. I'll start with a paracord lanyard secured to the pocket clip. With a light this small and with a black exterior, it would be pretty hard to find it in the dark if it were dropped. It would be helpful if Streamlight would include a lanyard ring or hole in the light where a lanyard could be attached.

Otherwise, this is a great light. I would buy it again and recommend it to others. I also recommend going to Streamlight's website to get all the information you can on this or their many other products. It is an excellent website, easy to use and very thorough. Also, don't forget to keep your purchase receipt in a place you can find it in the unlikely event the light fails.",the united states,"October 10, 2014",Desertguy,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:22.844430,2020-10-27 22:30:22.971450,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

As tough as it was that ended it. So, needing a replacement I order myself, and my Dad each one.

377,R1W03MKW0JPYN1,True,Pro-Tac 1L - sometimes doesn't turn on.,"The Pro Tac 1L is a good light except sometimes it doesn't come on unless I wiggle the tail cap slightly. I solved the issue by scraping away some of the paint on the threads and using a small aluminum foil shim laid across a small area of the body threads, but I shouldn't have to do this if it were designed right. The paint acts as an electrical insulator between two surfaces (body and cap) that require conduction to complete the circuit, and if Streamlight stopped putting paint/anodizing on the body and tail cap threads then the reliability of electrical contact would go way up. Other than that, it's bright, lightweight, and compact.

380,RBHW3FOJZXWYL,True,Best flashlight I've owned in 30 years,"Having been through many flashlights (fl) over the years of all battery sizes and bulb types this is hands down the best utility fl I've ever owned. The small size makes it convenient for daily carry and the clip is useful for keeping it close to hand. This is certainly the brightest fl I've ever owned, more powerful than my old 3 D Cell Krypton Mag Lite and definitely more versatile than my old Mini-Mag 2AA fl. Comes with a nylon cloth holster with velcro for the closure and belt loop, I'm not a fan of this kind of holster and don't use it.

Pros:
The strong beam setting is blinding and is the first selection when clicking, it could be used in a defensive or tactical situation for surprise, the low setting is good for working on items or using for situations where a bright light is not desirable, low is 3rd click..
The strobe is outstanding and blinding, it's the 2nd click; it's an excellent non-lethal defensive tool and desirable in a rescue situation.
Excellent battery life and solid construction.
Comes with two Duracell Ultra batteries.
Small, compact makes it easy to carry or conceal; great for a vehicle or bug-out bag.
Small enough to be used as a kubotan if necessary.
Can hold in mouth when you need both hands.
Rear activated rubber click-pad is easy to use.

Utility:
I carry a short length of white 12"" long nylon tubing in my gear that slides over the light and is secured by the clip, when lit the light resembles a mini light-saber; good for a tent lantern or illuminating a wider area while walking. The tube also makes you very visible, great for Halloween or other times where you may be out walking at night, can also be clipped to a pack or vest for hands free. The tube is also excellent for the strobe and makes an excellent signalling device. A couple of pieces of spotlight gels can also be used over the lens to change the color to red for night-time vision, such as hands free map reading.
The tubing is available here on Amazon: search for ""White Translucent Nylon 101 Round Tubing, 5/8"" OD, 9/16"" ID, 12"" Length"" if interested.

I've carried this for a while now, plenty of drops and no damage, actually got to use it on my first outing with it when my wife lost an earring in a haunted house, found it VERY quickly. The only way I could see this failing right now is from the rear click-pad switch as it may wear out over time, but that's not really avoidable.

Cons:
The flats don't really keep the fl from rolling, the pen clip does the best job here.
Batteries are expensive, roughly 1/3 of the cost of the fl but should last a long time.
Does not have a lanyard hole (could use loop in pen clip)
The pen clip occasionally pops off when inserting or removing from secured location.
Gets VERY hot on high (not complaining, just a fact but could be useful in a defensive situation).

Again, an excellent FL that I can see using for a lifetime, plan on getting several more the vehicles, wife and bug-out bags.",the united states,"September 18, 2013",nadagivinit,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:26.924617,2020-10-27 22:30:27.096868,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

382,R2BJJUS8DG8KEA,True,Compact & Bright,"I bought this flashlight to carry with me at work on the ambulance. Since I work the EMS peak hour shift the last 5 hours of my shift are at night and I needed a good, small, bright, dependable flashlight to carry.

I found it with this one.

PRO's

3 Modes
Bright: is perfect for lighting up a small area outdoors and will easily light up small rooms by its self w/o a problem
Strobe: (Thankfully) I have only had to use this once. this works great for disorienting & blinding people that might be trying to attack you. I have also flagged down other ambulances and stopped cars with it.
Low power: Is just what it says, A lower power less bright option. Handy indoors or in a crowd when you dont want to blind someone. It may be a little bright to check pupils with but it sill works.

Solid Construction
This flashlight is built solid, you can feel it the moment you pick it up. You dont really fret when you drop it. It sealed at both ends makeing it mater resistant. Lets just say this isnt something you are going to worry about breaking anytime soon.

CON'S

Batteries:
It uses 2 ""123"" batteries which if store bought are expensive. If you buy in bulk they are not so bad. They came out with rechargeable 123 batteries a few years back but I have yet to try them
The battery life is decent, with regular use (several times a day 5 days a week) the batteries are lasting me 1 to 2 months.

Watch out for the Heat:
The front end of the flashlight can really heat up when left on for any significant amount of time. It is not as bad in low power mode but anything more than 4 or 5 minuites on high power or strobe you will notice some heat to it.

Crappy case:
The case that they included with this flashlight was obviously made in china somewhere. When you get this flashlight chuck that case and get another one. The velcro started comming off after 2 weeks and it started to fall apart after about a month. Plus the inside of the case has velcro on the belt loop that can come loose when riding in cars.

384,R3ELM5NOOALP4,True,A great light in a small package.,"I just got my PT 2L about two hours ago, and I must say, this light is AWESOME.

This is my first experience with a tactical light, but I did do my research, so I knew what I wanted: something small and lightweight but bright, preferably with a strobe setting. And this little guy delivers on all counts.

The switch is quick and intuitive: one click for bright, steady on; two clicks for strobe; three for dim, steady on. You can lock any of these settings on by pressing through until the button clicks.

The light is also waterproof to one meter submerged, and they are serialized just in case. Combined with a lifetime warranty (barring batteries and abuse, of course), this is a great package for not a lot of cash.

I'm sure there are better lights out there, but be prepared to pay for them. If you're on a budget, or need a solid day-to-day light, this is definitely your winner.

EDIT 11/19/2012: I've been using this light for over a year now with absolutely no problems. My only complaint is that it tends to get hot if run on the full bright setting for very long. This is a small complaint, however, as the dim setting is still far brighter than a normal flashlight, even with the batteries low. Speaking of which, battery life is excellent under normal use. If you're using the bright setting a lot, you'll probably be replacing the batteries more often than I do, but a set of batteries usually lasts me several months.

A year later, I'm still giving this little beast 5 stars. I've dropped it, kicked it, soaked it, and generally abused it, but it's still going strong and doesn't have a mark on it.

387,R5C2B9IB4LXHP,True,"This is a great, small","This is a great, small, bright light (88031 Protac 2L Tactical), especially for the money. It's lightweight and the battery life seems very good, which I want as I intend to use it backpacking. I also have a Surefire P2X Fury which is larger and heavier (and twice as bright on the high setting). The Streamlight Protac works very well and is easy enough to re-program to the low/high switching combination I prefer. The option of having a strobe is a nice feature.

Comparing this Streamlight and the Surefire (which I know is not exactly apples-to-apples--the Streamlight 88040 would be a more equal comparison to the P2X) in terms of quality, it's evident that the Surefire is more solid--I feel like I could drive a nail with it--and the switch has a more robust feel, maybe partly because it requires a bit more force to click. The main body on the Surefire is larger in diameter (thicker tube) than the Streamlight. Just screwing the tailcap in you notice the difference in build quality. But at a much higher cost I expect a higher quality product. That's not to say the Streamlight feels cheap, it doesn't to me and if it continues to reliably shine light then it's doing all I need it to do.

I do prefer the whiter light of the Streamlight--the Surefire's light has a more yellow/warmer color cast to it.

All-in-all I'm very happy with my Streamlight 88031 Protac 2L Tactical, it seems robust and bright enough for my needs and so far it's been working perfectly.

389,R32A9B14G6TZ9M,True,Best flashlight I've owned so far,"The unit the seller sent was defective. It would come on, but wouldn't take the ""Ten-Tap"" programming and the strobe mode had an irregular pattern. I called Streamlight's support number to see if I was doing something wrong and a real person answered. He walked me through a couple quick things and then agreed with me that the light was defective. I sent it in and very quickly got a replacement back (the round trip took less than a week). The replacement has been working flawlessly for quite a few months. I've accidentally dropped it onto concrete floors a few times with no apparent ill effect. I wouldn't advise being intentionally careless with the light, but don't worry if you happen to drop it.

I like the fact that it has strike bezels on both the front and back. The back bezel provides a recess for the switch that does a good job of keeping it from activating while in my pocket. Battery life seems to be pretty reasonable. The light output is a nice white color and not too blue like a lot of ""white"" LEDs are. And let me tell you, for such a small flashlight, it puts out a L-O-T of light on the high setting.

UPDATE 2/1/2019: Four years later and the flashlight is still going strong. I use it all the time (several times a day, 7 days a week) and I rarely have to change the batteries. I should note that I set it to come on to the low setting by default. I find that I use the high setting only about 5% of the time. The low setting is plenty bright enough for most daily tasks.

Read more...","I'm a total Streamlight junkie and I have or have tried most of their tactical flashlights. When I saw the power output of the HL4, I was really excited. What I didn't know was that it's quite different than all the others in terms of the spot it makes. It has four LEDs and a frosted lens to diffuse the light everywhere. This is more like a wide ""flood light"". It really has no spot at all. Maybe there is an application for this, like illuminating a large room, but my needs require a higher intensity focused spot for greater distance. 2200lm is a lot of light for sure, but when you distribute that light over a huge area, it's not as bright as you'd expect it to be. It's not nearly as bight as the HL-3 for example at any distance. Combine that with it being really big and heavy as a rock and you have limited utility in most applications.

392,R2IAOW87M0OWKI,True,Perfect for night walks and for disaster situation,"For me, this is the perfect flashlight.
* Almost all the time, I will use it for night time walks. The ""Low"" setting of 13 lumens and 50 hours battery life is perfect for that. I changed the default program mode to ""Low-High"". I really wish it had a ""Low-High-Strobe"" mode, but it doesn't. The other modes are ""High"" only and ""High-Strobe-Low"".
* For emergency use, I really like the Strobe mode and its 6-hour battery life (on fresh batteries). It may make a difference in being rescued if I were to fall down a crack while hiking. I don't think the Strobe mode will make a difference in personal combat. It is blinding only if the attacker continuously stares directly at the light.
* During search and rescue, the 260 lumens for 3 hours will be a Godsend for spotting lost person or equipment. (It's bright, but looks more like 130 lumens to me.) I am thinking of also buying the 600 lumens tactical light for search and rescue use.
* Size is small enough to carry everyday. Fits in the palm of my small hand with 1 inch sticking out. Weigh only 3 oz without cover and 3.5 oz with cover (but feels comfortably hefty). Cover fits snugly and has straps to attach to loops or belts. I will probably carry it without the cover inside a small purse, or attached to the front of a shoulder-strap on my backpack. Body feels solid and well made. Probably will survive harsh conditions for several months outdoors in the event of a natural disaster. Also purchased bulk supply of CR123A batteries from Amazon.

393,RP559PTK5IIQX,True,Good light,"This is a good light. I like the USB charger and charge the light from my computer in my car. Streamlight has done a great job with he ProTac series of lights. I bought their ProTac 350lm for my rifle.

I gave it four stars because of one complaint I have. I do not like the push switch settings. It is a pain trying to use the lower light setting. I have had to practice to use the switch so I don't activate the strobe setting on accident, which I did a lot playing with it.

395,R17P2E8VKYSV0K,True,Great little light. Out shines most others,"I've had this for probably 2 years or more now and just have to give this little light plenty of credit. First off I'll mention the few things I dislike about it. The pocket clip. While its handy and I love it, at the same time its a love hate relationship. There has been probably a dozen or so times I went to clip this back into my pocket and the clip pops off the light. Annoying. It pops back on with relative ease, but still if you're not paying attention you can completely lose the clip, which I have done once but thankfully a co-worker found it a few days later laying somewhere near. Thats pretty much it!

Now what I like. The three click system takes a little to get used to but is simple enough, I love that it has the high, low and flash settings. Each has come in handy. I use the low setting frequently at home when looking for things and I don't need to be blinded. The flashing setting is great for getting peoples attention. I use it often at work. Usually people will stop and pay attention when they notice this thing flickering. And of course the bright mode is great at well, being bright as all heck. Its funny when I'm around other people in my line of work who also carry similar lights, Surefires and so on. So far I've beat them all out in brightness. The only thing that I've come across brighter is the new LED spot lights affixed to patrol cars.

I noticed one reviewer claimed he had an issue with 'battery rattle' I'd just like to note that I have not once been subjected to this in any form with this light in some two years and counting of heavy use. I've dropped it plenty of times on concrete, asphalt, steel, etc and theres only a few scratches on it and a few light dings. Seems pretty durable to me, heck the only place I've noticed much wear is on the very tip from being drawn out of and returned to my pocket so many times.

Oh and I nearly forgot the best part of this thing is the price here on Amazon. Since I've had mine I've noticed a pretty steady price point of $40.00 which you can't beat for a light of this quality. Probably one of the best purchases on Amazon I've made was taking a chance on this light.",the united states,"January 15, 2013",B. T.

It's just as bright, not noticeably brighter then the HL though. I really like the 10 click modes to choose your style. Very simple and effective. Quality is great as expected though a little rough and sharp, which means it scratches other surfaces very easy (automotive industry). I feel as though this light is maybe too bright for its own good. Because it is so bright, even light usage at high power mode gets the whole assembly hot and you end up feeling the heat in your pocket for minutes and minutes after just maybe 30 seconds of usage. It doesn't really burn you or anything but it's definitely noticeable. Also because it is so bright, the battery doesn't last very long. It's USB charged so you always have a chance to charge it.

399,R3F9XI0J9PLPCQ,True,"Outstanding flashlight, incredibly bright and very compact.","Best flashlight I've ever owned. Brighter than any Mag Light I've used and this thing fits in the palm of your hand. It's really amazingly bright, and the battery, though an odd size, does seem to last for quite a long time. I've got a ""super spotlight"" that isn't as bright as this little guy, and that spotlight runs out of battery power after literally 5 minutes or less.

Bonus: It's waterproof so when you drop it in a stream it's not dead.

Minus one star because it's pretty annoying that you can't program it to only do low and high beam, excluding the ridiculous ""flashing"" setting. Also you can't program it to start on low beam and then move up to high beam, it only starts on high and moves down. Most of the time low beam would be fine, and keep high beam in reserve for when you want that much power (and it is a significant difference). You can program it to be: High, Low, Flashing or High only, Low only. I set mine for high only. Sure, if you're an army ranger or in an actual survival situation the flashing thing might be handy but seriously... I bet 99% of these get used at home or in an office, flashy setting is not only unnecessary, it's flat out annoying.

But other than that minor (and it is minor) annoyance, this is a fantastic flashlight, especially at the price.

light that it produces it is just a phenomenal flashlight. I own 4 other
streamlights and this one is the biggest that I have. It's still compact
enough to be able to pocket. but big enough that you know exactly
what it is.

The light functions are excellent on it's brightest setting the light does
have very good range and an exceptionally wide range. The only
problem with that is if you were in a combat setting or if you were in a
defensive situation if you shine the light onto a bright wall or setting
expect to to have the flashlight blind you in return. I also like the strobe
setting as well. It is a great disorienting pulse of light. If someone were
to have adjusted to their night vision if they were to be hit with the pulses
it would vastly blind them. With the most bright setting and the pulse
this flashlight can become a very good defensive tool. The lowest setting
is for normal illumination.

The body is well constructed and the design is excellent. It's angled in
certain spots so it cannot roll when staged on a flat surface. The tip of
the light is recessed to become an excellent impact weapon. The rear
button is easily accessible and has a very positive button. The ten-tap
feature is very good at adjusting the programs on the flashlight.

406,RXIELL7RK85OZ,True,Very Nice Tactical Light With a Couple Gotchas,"This is a very well made tac light, very bright and compact. It uses a lithium battery which means it can sit around for years and still be ready when you need it. I like it, but there are a couple things to be aware of, especially for a tactical light, which means something that has to be 100% reliable and ready when you need it.

1) Hitting the mode you want is very tricky. You have to hit the switch just the right number of times (of course) and most tricky at just the right interval. The timing is VERY fast and it is different if you are going to use a particular mode temporarily (light press and hold button) or switching to that mode (press firmly and release staying on that mode). It takes practice, lots of it to hit the mode you want reliably.

2) When the battery runs out, there is absolutely NO WARNING. Either you will click it on and nothing happens or (most of the time) you will click it on and in a few seconds it goes dead. NOT a good situation for a tactical light. The only way this light can be absolutely ready for a critical situation is to put a new fresh $4 battery in it. Battery life isn't great, but that's the price for such a bright light running on a single CR123 battery. Just hope it is ready when you need it. A low battery indicator would be nice.

Still I gave it a soft 4 stars, maybe 3.5 would be more precise. It is a good light if you use it often enough to be good at hitting the right mode and if you have a fresh battery in it.",the united states,"August 10, 2013",Shutterbug,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:36.590654,2020-10-27 22:30:36.716968,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

407,R2VHFJXR34ZEAE,True,"Spotlight's on you, kid.","ProTAC HL3 Review: Holy crap! Whoever wrote the review about this thing being able to slice open a Tauntaun, they are absolutely correct. This is about as close as you can get to a lightsaber. It is extremely bright and you should absolutely use it with caution. The TenTap functionality is a great feature as well. It may not be apparent (I had to check the Streamlight website), but this flashlight does come with a nylon and Velcro carry pouch so you do not need to order one separately.

ProTAC 2AAA Review: This is the perfect light to carry around. It's light. It's bright. It's durable. The AAA version is nice and slim. The three-mode operation is intuitive and simple. Depressing the button for tap use, is awesome and cycling through the modes is super-easy. The only drawback is that the button is sometime difficult to 'click' on (not depress, don't get me wrong), but I am under the impression that is on purpose. Direct pressure with your fingertip clicks it on. Depressing it with just the pad of your finger may give you trouble. I would not remove a star for this at all.

408,R39MG494HO0UE1,True,Like a lighthouse that fits in your pocket :),"As I write this, I've only had my flashlight for two days but I want to give you my initial thoughts, in case they help. Then if something changes quality or usability wise, I will come back and provide an update.

So far, I think this light is the greatest bargain ever. It is replacing 6 not-cheap lights from Sam's that look GREAT but don't work due to broken switches. I suppose one could conclude that I am hard on flashlights, but I'm really not ... and I don't use them that often. So the not-cheap lights are very disappointing.

I spent more money on this Streamlight 88031 in hopes that it is the answer to my flashlight needs. If so, I'll be back to buy a few more -- I like to have multiple flashlights around my world.

Side note: I'll be judging this Streamlight 88031 against it's seemingly-indestructible little brother -- the Streamlight 73001 Nano Light Miniature Keychain light. That little light lives on my keychain so it gets a lot of abuse. And it still works 2 years later. So, this Streamlight 88031 has a big challenge to live up to the expectations its little brother has created for me about Streamlight quality.

Anyway, some quick notes about this Streamlight 88031:
1) The light is smaller that I expected. Apparently I lost track of size after looking at (what feels like) 5,000 different flashlights. So be sure to check the measurements before you order. For reference, this light is about the size of a dry erase marker. So, if you like a flashlight that is big enough that you could plunk a bad guy over the head ... this is NOT the light for you.
2) In retrospect, the size is perfect because it easily fits in my pocket. It would also be GREAT in a purse, briefcase, car, etc.
3) It's lightweight. It's heavier than a dry erase marker but not by much. I love that it's light enough to be in my nylon running pants without me hardly noticing. That certainly wasn't the case with my old crappy lights.
4) It's very bright! It's like having a lighthouse-bright light in my pocket. Sweet :)
5) The clip is fine. Works great if you like clips, and it's removable if you don't.
6) There is no lanyard clip. Not a big deal but I could see wearing this around my neck sometimes. I suppose I could tie a piece of paracord to the clip if I really wanted to (though I worry it might pop the clip off).

Bottom line: This Streamlight 88031 seems like a GREAT light. I'm very pleased so far. I will be back with an update if this doesn't last forever (unless it's my fault, of course :)

p.s. Update after 10 days ... As I said, this light is small but I love the fact that it fits in my pocket. It's a double-edged sword though because I have big hands which makes operating this light challenging at times since the light gets lost in my hand (my thumb slips off the back, etc.) I can completely conceal this light in my hand which means it isn't practical if I had to use it with a firearm. So, while I'm thrilled to have this light for pocket carry, for some things I need a flashlight that doesn't get lost in my hand. Just sharing the observation!

p.p.s. Update after 2 months ... I still really like this light. It's in my pocket nearly every night. I never want to be in the dark (or looking for things in dark places) without it. Also, this is a perfect sized light for your car or for a woman's purse (if you want to upgrade from the nano-sized keychain lights).

409,R298NAD7A3EZWK,True,Excellent value for a tactical light.,"After using and owning many tactical lights (cheap and expensive), I have been very impressed with the value of all the streamlights I have purchased. The 88031 Protac is no exception. I have several lights that are programmable (allow varying changes in intensity and/or strobe features), but it got to the point where I was forgetting how to program the different lights. This light, on the other hand, allows me to toggle through three modes (High intensity, strobe, and low intensity) quickly by repeatedly pressing the tail switch. This feature has made this light my favorite EDC, especially when traveling because it is quickly versatile and I don't have to remember how to program it. This is the same reason why I really like the 1AA protac that I use around the house (cheaper to feed it batteries). It is not, however, my night stand light. I still use a 4sevens Quark123(2) that is programmable (I leave the settings on high output and with a quick twist of the head of the light it goes into strobe mode). The Quark would be better in an emergency home defense situation because of that feature. The Quark was also almost twice the cost when I bought it though. Bringing me back to this light, I am extremely pleased with how good/bright the beam is. It is not quite as bright as a Surefire E2D, but it costs about a third as much and has a strobe function. Also, this light is incredibly lightweight with a smaller head than most lights that have less features. For the money, I couldn't be happier. Not to mention, I won't cry as much if I lose/break it compared to a $100 plus tactical light.",the united states,"February 18, 2013",Nash Campbell,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:36.978760,2020-10-27 22:30:37.104789,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

410,R2I6OM16Q5PMZK,True,Extremely impressed and satisfied!,"Wow, what a quality product. I bought this to replace an Extreme Beam that just didn't live up to it's hyped expectations. This Streamlight was 25% smaller, slightly lighter and although $20 more, it was significantly better in quality, function and lumen output. This thing is BRIGHT! 600 lumen bright. It lights up and entire room with no problem. The multi-function switch is outstanding. 1 Click for full bright, double tap for Strobe and Triple tap for low. The button works perfectly and you can feel it is a quality made Torch. It comes with two C123 Batteries and a belt sheath so it kinda makes up for the extra cost of other, cheaper brands. This flashlight is worth every penny and I plan to have one in each auto and the bedside. It's not to small that it underperforms and it isn't too large that it can't be worn in a pants pocket. Works well with various hand holds while operating a handgun and the inner diameter fits the popular 1 inch diameter flashlight adaptors that quickly attach / detach on weaver rails.

417,R3QASJHD9IY8HH,True,Perfect quality for the price - outstanding value & product,"I'd been looking to get a new flashlight for awhile and had heard a few recommendations for Streamlight but hadn't tried them personally. I'm a Surefire brand-stickler but am always willing to try something similar for less. While at a friend's house working on his car, he had a Streamlight, The Stinger, and I had a chance to use it for a few hours. I really liked the construction, light output and price. I was sold on owning one myself.

I spent a few days looking for the exact Streamlight I wanted, there are several models to choose from. I wanted something small, only a few inches in length, definitely hand-held rather than the almost full-size flashlight like my friend had. I wanted water resistance, and I wanted it to operate on CR123's, so I decided on this one.

When it arrives you get a belt clip which can be detached from the light, a ""pouch"" which holds the light and uses a velcro strap to attach to your belt. You also get basic instructions and a battery to start you off with. I'm still on the original battery and it's been a few months of every other day use. So far so good.

*** PERFECT FOR THE OUTDOORSMEN / ROUGH-USE / CAR-WORK / EVERY-DAY STUFF / SURVIVAL BAG

It comes ready to use once you get it, and for all of the reasons listed below it's truly a solid light to have. It's tough, shockproof, waterproof and easily carried. The diameter of the light allows you to easily attach it to firearms using the appropriate universal light mounts which you can obtain inexpensively.

*** GREAT BATTERY LIFE

Over 2.5 hours of solid use on High and more than 50 hours when set on low. This is really good, and the batteries which run the light are fairly inexpensive, especially if you purchase in bulk. Amazon has many solid deals for these batteries in bulk. Be aware that the light will warm up a little near the output end because of the LED. This is normal. It won't get hot it just gets warm, so don't fear that when it happens, especially after 30+ minutes. For the record, I'm still using the battery which came with the light and I've put at least 2 hours of High use on it and maybe half an hour of Low, and it's still working.

*** IT'S BRIGHT

The light output is outstanding, with brighter output than my Surefire x200 gunlight. This model states a light output of 180 lumens on high, which far exceeds my x200's rating of 110. You have two modes of brightness, high and low, and I find that for most jobs the low works great. Low isn't as bright as a cheap/average battery flaslight, but it's not dull, you can easily light up an entire room softly.

I've used the high mode to entirely light up small rooms in which the room lights were non functional. The rooms were all white on the walls and ceiling. I simply placed the light on a table facing the ceiling and turned it on high. The rooms, about 150sq/ft, lit up as if there was a 40watt bulb in the ceiling. I use a combination of both modes for various tasks including car work, house work, walking around the woods, etc.

It has a strobe mode which works on the High brightness level.

*** NO MAJOR BLIND SPOT

This light is neither a projecting light (fine focus for long distance lighting) nor a flood light, it's in between. Some lights which project long distances will give you a white blind spot if used in close quarters or on something near you. This won't do that, though if you use it close to something reflective such as a white wall, a good portion of the wall will be intensely lit-up. Outside at night you can see where you're going, but the bulk of the light won't be thrown for more than 50'.

This isn't a bad thing, most flashlights won't. It has enough flood to let you see where you're going, and enough throw to see far ahead of your footsteps. Other models of Streamlight will throw for long distances, if you're interested.

*** WATERPROOF

I needed something at least water resistant--I always buy things to last, and I'm going to use stuff in the rain it's simply inevitable. I also wanted to make sure that, like all flashlights I've owned before, I could drop this in water for awhile and not have an issue. It's rated for 30 minutes of submerged exposure at up to 1 meter (3.3'). I haven't tried it at that depth or for that long myself, though I've seen them underwater for longer at gun shows. I have used this light inside of a few aquariums up to a foot deep, and it performed perfectly.

*** SHOCKPROOF

Another thing on my must-have list. I've already dropped it several times from about 4', right onto concrete, and it continues to function flawlessly. There's a bit of a ding in the aluminum of course, to be expected.

*** 3-WAY SWITCH MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE TO GET USED TO

Once you realize how it works, it's super-easy. The switch allows you to use momentary force to turn the light on only as long as you hold the switch, and also allows you to switch the light ""on"" by pushing it all the way in like a normal light. Here's the easiest way to describe it:

1. Hold the light as you would, and begin slowly pushing the switch in until the light comes on. This is the momentary-on point. If you release, the light goes off.

2. If you continue to push until it clicks, it stays on. Click it off to turn the light off.

3. To switch between modes, try this: Push the button until you get the light to come on (not all the way until it clicks). Now quickly release enough pressure until it turns off, and then push it back on just until the light comes on. This should be your strobe mode. If you do this again you'll reach the 3rd mode which is Low.

To get any of these modes (High / Strobe / Low) to ""stick"", you just push all the way until it clicks on. Once you've practied a few times I guarantee you'll get the hang of it.

*** CLOSING THOUGHTS

The only thing which bugs me is knowing what the lense is made of. I can't tell if its glass or a high impact acrylic. My Surefire lights use glass, which won't scratch, and are unlikely to be broken. A high impact acrylic would be near impossible to break but could scratch. Again, I have no idea which this light uses. Either way this is still a solid light. For the price, especially if you're an Amazon Prime member, you get this thing in a day and it's ready to go out of the box. I used two of these recently during a hurricane and they were superb.

418,R3BZ878INWOZ1R,True,Should of bought this one in the first place.,"First off I've noticed these reviews are for multiple different flashlights. I bought the 600 lumen ProTac HL. Great flashlight for its build quality and the programmable tailswitch. Nice to be able to turn in on first in the low setting then to the high setting if needed. This comes in handy when you need the light for a low light situation and you won't be temporarily blinded by the 600 lumen blast. A note on lumen counts. Lumens are NOT a measure of light intensity. Its a measure of total light thrown by a light. Example a lowly little 14 Watt CFL light bulb that I have as my nightstand light produces according to the label 1,250 lumens. Obviously if I shine this light on it on its high 600 lumen setting, the flashlight is staggeringly brighter. Other companies overinflate the lumen counts by adding a shallow reflector spreading the light out wider. The Candela (cd) rating is the closest to the light intensity rating you can get. At 16,000 cd this light is one of the brightest on the market. (There is a 15,000 ""older"" version of this light, but I got the new 16,000 version so you should get it too). Don't be afraid of the ""special"" CR123 batteries. True, they can be found at $20 a two pack in some major drugstores. But online they can be bought in bulk for less that $2 a battery.

I purchased it because we were going out of the country to a destination where crime had been on the rise and I wanted something that would be legal to travel with on the plane as well as the destination. I also wanted something that would deter/prevent an encounter rather than defend - and boy this was it. Long story short, we stayed in a rather large villa on a cliff overlooking the ocean. The nearest place to us was about 300 yards away up a hill. On the last day we started noticing that items were going missing and that night we came back to find a window opened that we knew we had secured. Thankfully there were many of us to go in two groups to search the villa to be sure no one was hiding. After we were sure there were no uninvited guests we began to unwind and, about two hours later, a person in our group went to their room upstairs to get something and when they came back down they happened upon two men with shirts wrapped around their heads going through a purse that was left out. That person screamed for help and the men ran out the door. We all ran upstairs and called the police. In two hours the police arrived (was pretty lax kind of place) and they looked around the house. I followed the one cop outside and he pulled out a flashlight to see if anyone was hiding in the shrubs/thick that surrounded the villa. It was a substandard light. As he was squinting to see only 50 ft away I pulled out my light and lit the entire area like a ballpark. Stunned, he turned around, looked at me then my light and, with an approving nod said, ""nice light"". We scanned the rest of the property and concluded the burglars were hiding on the one hillside and waited until we were all on the lower level before sneaking in. I don't know about anyone else, but I wasn't going to bed and three of us stayed up and talked until sunrise - and we scanned the property from a high vantage point in the villa every 10 minutes or so. Whoever was out there, wasn't about to come back and we felt much better with this kind of ability to light up the area at hand. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone who may be subjected to this scenario. On top of that it's just a great tool to have and the fun hasn't stopped there although this event was the time it was needed the most - and hopefully the last! Only problem I have had was when something in my backpack compressed the top of the holster where the actuating button was and kept it on in my bag. The heat from the light burned a home through the bottom of the holster, but caused no other damage - so be careful when storing - not because of the damaged holster, but because I would not have had a charge to use the light when needed had I not discovered the battery was fully discharged.

I like the fact that if i want more power I can just keep the cr123a battery, (that comes with the light) with me in my backpack and swap it out whenever.

425,R2D9K6QR4E1WJO,True,best pocket flashlight!,"If you need a light for you cargo pocket, EMT kit, go-bag, lanyard, etc...then friend this is the light for you!

I got one, wasn't a fan of the cost given it was just a simple small flashlight, but boy was a pleased how well it worked! Enough so i've gotten 2 more since for dropping into my go-bag for deployments. And where I go there are always mountains of AA batteries, so this light is perfect for me, because i can always get my hands on AA with no issue, and with little/no cost.

I love the 3 ""setting"" of brightness, which are just a matter of bumping the button once, twice, or three times for low, med, high. But what i love is that 90% of the time i never need more than the low lumen setting to see in the dark, and keeping it mostly on low, I've been able to go months with heavy use on a single battery. But there have been times i needed the full lumen that this lil puppy packs and even then still gotten all the use I needed, i just changed the batteries (better safe than sorry) since they were abundant and free, but I've never had it die on me.

The lil pouch is nice, esp if you need to wear it on your EMT belt, i chose to dump it and use the clip and keep in in my cargo pocket like a knife. On water rescue missions i throw it on a lanyard on my PFD as a backup for spotting the shoreline.

426,R3IWL7KYQORG6A,True,Terrific Light,"If you had to own one flashlight, this might be the one.

It isn't tiny, but it's very small. It comes with a clip so you could clip it to your pocket and although at first I thought this was a bit of a joke (I think it's way too big for anyone's pocket), it occurred to me that it might be handy to be able to clip it to the outside of your pocket for easy access. Admittedly it's more prone to getting knocked off this way, but it's just something to keep in mind. (It also comes with a belt holster if that's your thing.) If you WERE to knock it off, I suspect it would take the impact very well. It feels very solid in your hand and is made entirely of metal.

Of course the principal feature of the light is, well, the light. It's incredibly bright. It's no 2200-lumen Olight SR-90, but for its size, it's nearly impossible to beat. Its 640 lumens are more than enough for anything around the house, and still plenty adequate for most outdoor applications. True, if you're trying to locate someone lost in the ocean from a helicopter in the middle of the night, you might want something with a little more kick, but for 95+% of all tasks, I suspect this light will more than fit the bill.

My chief complaint might be unique to my particular unit, but to me, the clicking mechanism feels a bit cheap - certainly worse than Streamlight's smaller cousin, the ProTAC 2L. Perhaps it's just because the device is larger, but the this light requires a much deeper push on the tail switch to turn the light on. It's a little harder on the thumb and just makes the whole thing feel a little cheaper. In the grand scheme, not that big of a deal, but it's what keeps me from giving this light the five stars that so many others have.

428,R25TA5F1X6049L,True,Mounted On My Mossy 590 A1 Blackwater,"Tried a cheaper light on my full-size Mossy(590A1 Blackwater) tactical shotgun. It didn't last the first trip to the range.

Granted, it's a little long for a mounted firearm light. But on a full-sized weapon, the extra 2"" or so matters little.
The strength and focus of the beam is fantastic, the strobe-mode easy to access with a quick dbl tap. Despite the length(approx. 7""), it's slim and worked just fine in my existing rail mount. Could have bought something smaller but firearms lights can get very pricey, on a full-sized shotgun a super-small light is irrelevant.
Good balance of price and durability, reliability (key in ANY situation where tools MUST work EVERY time)considering my own application.

431,R2PVIK8IAH3OTL,True,the pinnacle of flashlightdom (past tense),"this is my trusted sidekick at work. runs on cr123z and it makes them last. has three settings, cycled by multiple pushes of the switch. starts on bright, then strobe (only good for irritating ppl), then lower up close light. it does get a bit hot, but that is expected since it pushes 180 lumens. my only suggestion for improvement would be some sort of replaceable rubber sleeve for the inevitable tooth hold. but this would only put this light up to 6 stars. if you are hemming and hawing over this or a surefire, save your child's college fund and get this one.

update: i have since replaced this on my belt with its big brother, the protac HL. meaner and just as leaner, but with a larger head. the lowly 2L was relagated to the door pocket of the truck, where it has performed flawlessly on more occasions than i will admit. i just threw it in there without so much as a second thought and have had to use it for things such as spare tire changes, and checking the campsite for the truck keys so we could go home at the end of the camping trip. battery conservation is good too, all things considered. still a great light for the money, and unless you own any of the other higher output lights, this will make you happier than a puppy with two peters.

update 4/18/14: this has since made its way into my hunting pack. outside opinion would call that a downgrade. quite the contrary. i trust this light to come on after rain, snow, hail, dusty atv rides, 10 mile hikes, etc. it has not yet failed me. i carry 4sevens lights on my belt now, but this will always have a place somewhere in my flashlight stable. its only fault, as i mentioned above, is that there are brighter lights out there. if you are not a flashlight-o-phile then this light will do everything you need a flashlight to do.",the united states,"November 24, 2012",greatwhite22,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:51.456371,2020-10-27 22:30:51.579116,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

432,R1PJ119JX3HX4N,True,260 lumens is easily enough for most applications you'd expect out of an ...,"No, it's not the brightest 2-cr123a flashlight on the market. No, it doesn't have some bizarre 36 mode UI that requires you to carry a cheat sheet to navigate. What the Protac 2L does, it does very well. 260 lumens is easily enough for most applications you'd expect out of an easily pocketable torch. The UI is simple with a handful of modes in each UI version that suit most styles of use. The controls are dead simple. The construction robust enough. The size is perfect for my hands and pocket. It is about the largest light I can comfortably carry inside my rear pants pocket clipped to the outside corner of said pocket. It's perfect size for Harri Technique for me as well.

But the biggest factor for me, personally, is that I've lost three of them so far. My job requires me to be outside in the field, climbing on equipment, getting down on the ground, going underneath equipment and structures, etc. This is not a friendly environment in the slightest if you're actively attached to your gear. I fell on one, catching the clip against a skid loader and rocketing the light and my wallet out of the pocket. Obviously I went for my wallet first. The light got eaten by the loader. The second was left underneath a car (I guess, because I don't remember), and the third got eaten by mud in a landfill when I dropped it. Wasn't going swimming to get it. Why is this mentioned as a feature? Because at under $40 I don't mind losing it. If I lost three Surefire E2E's, man, I would be PISSED. Heck, I probably would've at least driven my hand into that landfill mud to get a Surefire or some other spendier light back.

Yet even at the price point, the more expensive lights don't perform so vastly much better that I feel short-shifted because I can't feasibly carry the spendy light.

So if you want a torch you can brag about to your buddies, go down to the candlepower forum and geek out. They have all the goods on some really awesome stuff. But if you want a torch you can carry in the field, use the crap out of it, and not cry if you lose it, grab one of these. After trying out more torches than I can count, the ProTac 2L is the far-and-away class leader on value.

433,RJ7PJWU0LOG75,True,ridiculously bright,"i have the streamlight protac 2L and i love it. i saw this one and i knew i had to have it to stun friends and amaze co-workers. it does both. waaaaaaaay bright without being waaaaay expensive. it's not fenix cheap, but it is reasonable for what you get. it is roughly the same diameter as the 2L except for the bezel, which is larger. takes two cr123's and the runtime is considerable, considering the light output. it has three modes that you can run thru...high, strobe, low...and they are just another push of the switch away. i like the simplicity, no moonlight mode, starlight mode or ultra-moon starlight mode. still not sure what the real purpose of the strobe is. if you really want to stop an attacker, why just give him a siezure? melt him with the high beam. my light would have been 5 stars, but it has an odd hiccup every so often. it switches modes on its own. both times it happened in extreme cold weather after it had been on for over 5 minutes. i will investigate further since i really do like this light and it beats 47 and surefire in the lumen/price column.

update: i have not had this light repeat the weird mode switch. possibly it was doing this due to low batteries? anyways, among my belt carry edc lights, this one is king. so i thought i'd better come back and give it its star back. foursevens quarks are pretty slick, but this one will hold its own.

434,R1COXRXMJN8QDY,True,Why didn't I buy this flashlight sooner?,"Some years back I asked my father for a Surefire rechargeable incandescent tactical light for Christmas that cost a few hundred dollars and I've regretted it ever since. The rechargeable battery wouldn't hold a charge long enough to be trusted in an emergency and the burn time was so short that it was useless as a utility light.

Finally I got up the emotional courage to buy a replacement light and the Streamlight ProTac HL is such an amazing light it makes me feel even WORSE about the Surefire. This light is everything a tactical flashlight should be: small enough and light enough to easily carry and use with one hand, blisteringly bright, and durable enough to get kicked around on the ground without any problems. For a flashlight that is only slightly longer than a man's fist is wide, I don't think there is a brighter commercially available product at this time. I also love the fact that it has various brightness levels so that you can also use the flashlight to navigate a dark room or read a map in the car without burning out your retinas. My only complaint is seemingly common to all LED lights with variable brightness. All brightness levels lower than full blast HIGH, are achieved by strobing the LED light ""quickly"" to reduce it's overall light output. While the light flashes faster than the ""strobe"" feature that is designed specifically to be dizzying, the flicker of the low level light is still quite annoying. I'm sure there must be some technical reason that the light manufacturers can't make the LED flash any faster because this seems to be a wide spread complaint. It really is quite annoying and I can appreciate the safety concerns voiced about using such a light to inspect moving equipment such as fans, belts, pulleys, etc as the strobing effect can make moving equipment appear to be stationary to be moving much slower than they are in reality.",the united states,"December 27, 2012",Byron Flagg,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:51.838694,2020-10-27 22:30:51.961013,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

435,R2HBAOG9SNMGH2,True,Very Nice Light...,"This is the best of the tactical flashlights that I have. Though small, it has a really powerful high beam light. That seems to be the default level of illumination. I use that beam often when I take my dog out for a pre-bedtime bio break in a large meadow beside our house. Sometimes after she relieves herself she decides to sniff all the exciting scents on the furthest side of the meadow (she's a Lab...all nose and mouth). Notwithstanding, I can easily follow her with the bright light, until she satisfies herself that she knows who and what has been there and joins me to go back into the house.

The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it's hard to activate the other levels of the light. There is also a low beam, and a strobe level. The lower level light extends the battery life by scores of hours and usually is just fine for walking, etc. But it's hard to activate. You have to lightly push the switch on the end of the flashlight partway down three times then hold it and push the button down until it clicks on. Similarly, to activate the strobe you push the button down lightly two times then hold and push it until it clicks on. It's not quite as easy as it sounds, but if you do it enough, you get the hang of its operation. The instructions were unclear (to me) and I felt pretty frustrated when I could not get it to operate properly.

I thought something was wrong with the light and called the company. They referred me immediately to a very cooperative technician who gave me much better instructions but said if I couldn't get it to work, send it back and they'd send me another one. They were very nice at all levels. So now that I've figured it out, I'm thrilled and considering buying another (a $40 flashlight is still pricey in my world) to keep with my outdoor gear.",the united states,"December 5, 2012",Neal,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:51.964985,2020-10-27 22:30:52.090268,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

436,R35MNLGEV5EGYM,True,This will be my favorite light for many years to come.,"I've had this light for a little over 2 years now and I haven't been gentle on it. Its been dropped, and smashed and it shows little to no wear at all. While the battery isn't so common to find, I have to replace the batteries maybe twice a year (I use the light mainly on low.) The high is definitely effective when you need light fast and bright and low is more than enough (but not too much) for everyday use. The strobe is quick and very bright and the half push switching system makes finding the mode you want very quick. This will be my favorite light for a long, long time, I've tried to find a light the same size that could beat it but I simply can't. I usually carry this using the pocket clip (which is better even some of the pocket clips on the much more expensive lights) and it never slips off, even while running or moving up stairs. For me, this light is the perfect size and thickness for nearly every task, and it goes everywhere with me. Its lasted a long time through hard use and there's no sign of it breaking anytime soon.

Edit: It's now 2016 and this light is still my go to light. I've smashed it, submerged it and treated it harshly in every manor possible, it's been with me in 30 degree whether as well as 110 degree whether, even after as much abuse as it has been through, still not a single issue with it. The light has never failed me no matter what conditions I'm in, it's survived many hard drops and still almost no damage to the light. The paint is in fair condition, it's high quality to go through all that and still have only minor scratches. Pocket clip retention is still as good as it was the first year I got it (pocket clip tends to wedge itself up against the ridge above where it sits, really helps to get even more retention.) Clicky button on the back is still good, hasn't even begun to wear out.

However, the push-button light switch on the end of the light is not recessed enough, so when you're wearing the light in its nylon case on your belt, the button can accidentally get pushed and the light turned on. This happened to me last week, and because I was unaware the light was on, the metal casing actually heated up so much that it actually burned my skin through my pant waistband. The metal casing was extremely hot -- so much so it was hard to grab and take out of its nylon case so I could turn it off and set it on top of a cabinet to cool off. That's only happened once. And to be perfectly honest I do still carry the light every day as part of my every day carry. But the manufacturer really needs to look into the excessive heat this thing generates if you accidentally leave it on. And also the push button on the end of the light should be better recessed, so it can't as easily be accidentally turned on while you're wearing it. For the price, I shouldn't have to be checking it for or five times a day to make sure the light's not on.",the united states,"March 11, 2015",Steve B,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:52.221666,2020-10-27 22:30:52.342461,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

442,R2A54FMAU6JXVQ,True,Monstrously Bright; A bit Bulky,"This review should really be for ""4.5 stars"" but that option was not available. I knew of the single shortcoming of this product before buying it, because I had read other Amazon reviews and seen this item in a walk-in (police equipment) store.

First of all, it's a little powerhouse (600 lumens: WOW!) And, it's manufactured by Streamlight, a Pennsylvania outfit with lots of ""cred.""

Also, the Amazon price was exceptional: I got it for fifteen bucks less than the price in that store -- sufficient difference for me to not patronize a local businessman. (I had resolved in my mind only to buy it here only if the price difference were $10.00 or greater.)

Finally, the down-side: as another Amazon reviewer mentioned, the bulbous head prevents easily slipping this in or out of a pocket with the reflector and lens pointed down, and the clip is pointing in the wrong direction if you want to hang the light facing upwards to compensate. (He was incorrect in his suggestion that the pocket clip should be turned around and attached at the opposite end -- there is not enough room on the barrel of the flashlight near the head to accommodate this adjustment.)

So all in all, a solid bargain and an impressive little piece of technology -- but the Streamlight folks need to widen the flat spot on the barrel near the head so the clip can be flipped.",the united states,"September 19, 2013",Science_Geek,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:30:57.049163,2020-10-27 22:30:57.173890,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The button on the end cap can be used for momentary on, or pressed harder for continuous on. It starts out bright, then strobe, and then low - which is perfect for more tactical use. The batteries are long lasting (I've only changed my once in this past year) - which is something I really like about this CR123A version of the Protac.

452,R3CSHXYQYXGM1T,True,Great light,"Just bought this light as a second/backup to my primary stinger I use for duty. I had read other reviews that said if you just got the light and the charging cable it wouldn’t fully charge. I got the whole package for that reason.

Charging seems to be quick. And I do get the green light when it is fully charged. I really like the it you can toss regular lithium ion batteries in it if the rechargeable battery dies.

The nylon holster that comes with it isn’t something I would wear on a duty belt but it works fine to attach it to a bag.

The hot spot isn’t as focused as the stinger HL I also carry. But you do get quite a bit of throw and it lights up the area very well... I would say you could identify a target at least 250 yards away.

The light is easy to hold and I thought I might not like only having the tail switch but that hasn’t been a problem at all.

Overall I would say it’s a great light, it’s awesome you can charge it with a USB cable so you can really take it on the go easily.",the united states,"April 9, 2019",Bachp,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:31:02.544471,2020-10-27 22:31:02.667654,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

453,RN6SRH3K5CUQ0,True,"The Optimum ""Carry"" Light","OK I admit it. I am a flashlight nut, always looking for the optimum lighting solution. When I labeled all my boxes and put them in alphabetical order I discovered I have 3 boxes of flashlights. If you think you might need a club, carry a D cell mag light. For hands free, my Streamlight Septor with 3 AAA's is my go to head lamp. I have been looking for the optimal ""carry"" light for any pocket, or for my cool 5.11 tactical pants. Lithium batteries provide energy density that alkaline batteries can't match which means more lumens that last longer so I wanted a twin that was small in diameter and short enough to fit anywhere. Next the ten tap programming is the icing on the cake that completes this package. I have three different models of this ""ten tap"" light. One is too big. One is to small (1 battery). I have them all programmed the same. The third program setting is #1) one click for ""on-low"" which is usually enough and good for 50 hours. Next #2) two quick clicks for ""on-high"" which is easy to function if I need it, which I rarely do. For my applications it is not a battery hog.

454,R2B5FJ1PSDHOCH,True,Could be the perfect flashlight of its kind???,"I am very happy with the Protac 2L and will cover my pros and cons of this light herein however I should begin this review by saying that I am flashlight brand agnostic and own many lights including Surefires, Petzl's, Pelican's, Streamlights and Underwater Kinetics. Each of these lights have their own purpose. It is obviously not useful to compare a dive light to a headlight meant for camping. A reasonable point of comparison emerges between the surefire and streamlights especially the ""tactical"" lights. What I express here is only my opinion but I have to say that while I own 5 or so Surefire's they tend to be overly heavy and two of them have had failures shortly after purchasing them. My executive light's tailcap switch failed and my AR weapon light's momentary contact switch also failed. These lights are premium priced and for that premium I would expect outstanding quality. But of course this is a review of the streamlight Protac 2L and in contrast I have experienced no failures with this light. It's three modes work incredibly intuitively. The bright setting maximizes the output of the C4 LED. Strobe mode is easy to activate and it is very disorienting as it is intended to be. My favorite mode though is the low mode. It is great to have a light that can put out such a blinding beam also produce a low mode that is useful and yet greatly extends battery life. The crenelated ends are sharp but non-intrusive. In a tactical situation they would come in handy. My only complaint is that the body is very smooth and sometimes when you try to lock the tailcap switch the smooth aluminum slides through your fingers. I also like how light, thin and short this flashlight is. It carries in one's pocket very easily without a lot of added weight or bulk. The holster that comes with the light is actually is serviceable. I think it would work for daily carry. Overall, I can't recommend this light highly enough. I just ordered two more and look forward to traveling with them and putting them into service on a daily basis. The only person I can imagine not rating this light number one is someone going into actual combat who might want something that was heavier but given my poor experiences with Surefires, I am not sure what I would recommend. If you buy this light I would be very surprised if you have anything but a great experience.",the united states,"December 3, 2010",W.

455,R30KDBALJ8AKOI,True,New version now shipping,"I don't usually add my $.02 to a product when many others have already spoken so overwhelmingly in favor of it. But in this case, the item I received deserves a special mention because Streamlight has improved the product, although it now costs a few dollars more.

Many, many reviewers cite their biggest (often only) issue being an inability to modify the program of selections that are available by tapping the button. With the current product release Streamlight has addressed this issue by adding their ""Ten-Tap"" programming to this flashlight.

The unit ships with the high-strobe-low program set as the default. This used to be the only program the unit had. Now it can also be programmed to have high-beam only or low-high selectable in addition to the standard program. For my use the low-high program is perfect and made this flashlight a slam-dunk for my daily carry.

An additional change is that the high beam is now 180 lumens rather than 110. Low beam is still 12 lumens, which I believe is unchanged. Battery life is 2 hours on high and 24 hours on low but I do not know if these values are different from earlier versions of this flashlight.

458,RJMBN8ZORZAM3,True,This is the best light I have ever owned by far.,"When I was in law enforcement, I carried various brands of lights and always found Streamlight to be the most durable and well designed lights on the market. The PT2L is no exception. This is by far the best flashlight I have ever owned. I purchased this light several months ago when my Surefire G2 turned out to be a piece of junk (and Surefire's customer service declined to respond to my repeated attempts to contact customer service). The Streamlight PT2L turned out to be a great surprise.

First, this light is very compact and well-built. The light will easily fit in your pocket and is lightweight. The clip is sturdy as well. For added versatility, I added a neck lanyard that I attached to the clip. Second, this light is BRIGHT! Compare it to lights that are much larger and more expensive, and you'll find that the PT2L is brighter than most. It blows my Streamlight Stinger out of the water in the amount of light it puts out. The light is a clean white light as well. Third, it has a low power setting when you don't need as much light or need to extend the life of the batteries as long as possible. It also has the strobe feature, which is nice to have, but not something most people will ever actually need. Fourth, the light comes with a set of CR123A lithium batteries that are reasonably priced, easy to find, and have a very long 10 year shelf life.

The only down side to this light is that it does get pretty darn warm if you need to run it for a long time, but that is the payoff for getting the bright light since I understand that the aluminum body is used to draw heat from the lamp to allow for the brighter light capability.

In short, for the money you simply can't get a better light.",the united states,"July 21, 2011",Browncoats Unite!,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:31:03.316612,2020-10-27 22:31:03.440200,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

463,RKOM3CR70ZIYD,True,Streamlight 88031 Protac Tactical Flashlight 2L with White LED I,"I'm not ""flashlight manic"" or an expert so I can only say that this ""tactical"" flashlight appears to do what it's supposed to do in ""tactical"" situations. It projects a strong beam of light - it's shape & size makes it easy to carry and use to blind/ ward off aggressors (at least long enough to take further defensive action - the whole point of such flashlights).

Compared to one larger multi-LED flashlight, this flashlight produces MUCH more light and even reflecting the beam in a mirror can ""blind"" at short ranges.
Not sure what the battery life will be - have to wait and see (and not keep ""trying it out"" as I was at first). It's the only device I have which uses CR123 batteries, so I'll have to look around for local battery sources before passing judgement on that part.

Got my first one a couple weeks ago - then got 2 more from Amazon for Xmas gifts (daughter & her husband). One of those two wouldn't work no matter what I tried. It'll be going back to Amazon pronto - customer service says they're shipping a replacement right away.
Thanks for that - I gave my own to daughter so she'd have one to take back home (and to work- she's a grade school teacher).

Worth the cost? WEll - if it can save a life, it's worth it. I've seen other places advertize the exact same flashlight for $75 - so it wins price comparison-wise.

464,R2ZZFTOQ6VAMRI,True,great tac light... not so great clip,"I would have given this a 5 star except for the fact the clip is poorly designed and breaks away much too easily.
if the lip of your pocket is a bit thick (think Kuhl heavy duty pants) it is impossible to clip the light without the clip popping off. Eventually I noticed that the clip was gone but thankfully the light was still in my pocket.

As for the light... top notch light. Seems to hold up very well in my pocket next to a Krenshaw knife. The black coating does scratch off a bit on the easy side but I don't care about looks... i want the light to work every time I need it. I don't leave home without it. Battery life seems decent. I don't usually use the highest setting as it tends to be too bright (but it does come in handy when I need a lot of light.) I have had mine for a while and haven't changed the batteries yet.

Just a note, on the brightest setting, the body will warm up over time. I accidentally switched on the light while it was rolling around in my pocket (since I lost the clip) and it got pretty hot... not burning hot but hot enough to make you notice.

465,RT5IP2TRVDO1Z,True,Definitely worth it!,"I purchased this to install inside of a Elzetta Tactical Shotgun Flashlight Mount for use on my Winchester 1300 Defender, which it fits great inside of. I haven't had the light on for very long, so I'm not sure if the bulb gets darker after it's been on for a long time. However, at least right now the light is crazy-stupid bright. I have never purchased a flashlight this expensive before and have never had a true tactical light, but it seems like for the price it is well worth the money.

I didn't quite understand how to change into different modes at first. The way you switch modes is by lightly depressing the cap switch ""on"" button 2x or 3x depending on which mode you want. So you don't click it all the way down so it locks on, but just barely depress it until the light switches on, then quickly release the pressure and push down lightly again. This puts it into a strobe-light mode. I'm assuming that mode is to disorient the assailant, but frankly it was disorienting to me as well. I don't know. Kind of cool. Never seen that feature before but I guess it makes sense.

Long story short: this light is great. Well worth it. I've never owned a Surefire so I don't know how it would stack up. But it's definitely way better than your average flashlight. The only downside is that it uses those CR123 batteries which aren't always readily available.

467,RRRZJHR9UKR5C,True,Absolutely Phenomenal.,"This is a great light. It is competitively priced and is a nice size for pocket carry in men's jeans. I wear a slimmer cut pants (not skinny jeans lol) and there is no noticeable bulge in my pocket. The unboxing experience was plesant. Packaging was about standard, and was well put together. The light came with 1 CR123A (more about this later), 1 AA, the light (duh?), a pouch, and a wrist strap. I pocket carry this light only so I haven't used the pouch yet but it could be useful for storing things in and seems to be of good quality.

Pros:
Quite bright, with a nice balance between distance and width. The light can easily reach 200 ft or so while having a wide enough beam to provide good peripheral visibility.
Durable (so far). I have already dropped it several times on concrete and other than a few scratches it works like a champ, although I expected this.
The hat clip feature is useful. It is worth noting that the part of the clip contacting the bill of the hat is rounded over so it won't damage the front edge of the hat. Nice touch!
The pocket clip is nice and sturdy, and I haven't had any issues with it sliding around or falling out throughout the day.
The feature to be able to use AA batteries is awesome. I prefer to use a CR123A in order to achieve the full brightness, however it is very nice to have the option should I not have any CR123As on hand or if I don't feel like wasting the more expensive battery on a less demanding task. I imagine this feature would be very nice while camping or doing other things as AAs are far more prevalent and cheaper than CR123As.
The tail switch is extremely easy to actuate while not turning on in my pocket easily. Strobe is also very easy to actuate (double tap).
The end of the flashlight, near the bezel, is flattened on several sides so the light won't easily roll around. This is a nice detail.
The lens and the glass (I believe it is acrylic of some sort) is recessed which is nice as it won't scratch or become damaged as easily.

Cons:
I would have liked for the pocket clip to carry a little further down in my pockets, as almost the entire screw on tail-cap portion sticks out. Although as long as you don't care about it being super concealed (it is just a flashlight after all) I can usually just tuck my shirt over it and it isn't much of an issue.
I wish there was a way to possibly program the light to go High > Low > Strobe by single, double, and triple tapping. Currently, it is setup as High > Strobe > Low, and I find that I have to press it up against my clothing while actuating because the strobe function will turn on momentarily while switching to low which is quite blinding, especially when you need a lower amount of lumens to begin with.
Not really a con, but the battery that came with the flashlight died very quickly, within the span of 1 week with not much use. However, I ordered a pack of 2 CR123As with the flashlight and the battery life of those are much improved.

468,R26DSQVLHLA3L7,True,A dissapointment of Streamlight.,"Great light intensity but you have the same intensity with for example nitecore.
The battery lasts only for about an hour, there is no indication that the battery is low, it just quits.
And then it takes about 7 hours to charge.
The fact that you can charge it with usb is great, but i received the item already with something like sand or something in the bottom o-ring of the usb cover, so i don't know if it is still waterproof, i don't think so. The flashlight is larger than on the picture and heavier.
After a fall of not even 10cm on the table there was already a dent in the topcap.

469,R2RRRFEWR3IZPS,True,Favorite!,"I have probably owned about 4 dozen flashlights so far in my life and this one is hands down my favorite. I use a flashlight everyday for work and my old one broke so I had to replace it. I have always been a huge fan of Streamlight but I've realized their ""cheaper"" flashlights don't last much longer than a year for me. Granted I haven't had this one a year yet but I got a Great feeling about it. Just from the build and feel of it I can tell it's quality. For me it's the perfect size, it's not so small that I drop it all the time or would lose it easily but it's also big enough to have a solid grip and fits my hand perfect and comfortably. Another thing I really liked is the belt sheath it came with. Many of them that come with the lights are cheap and break in a week. This one is much more heavy duty and the light hasn't fallen out yet. I know it's programmable but I have not utilized that feature. The light tap to change settings is easy to get used to. It is extremely bright, but I do wish the low setting was a hair brighter but I'm still more than satisfied. The strobe setting is also pretty cool although I have no real use for it.

470,R1ZQ474IRYH2XN,True,"Great Value, High Quality","I do not believe in writing a review until a few months after using the product. With that said, I have now used it for awhile, and I am in love with it. At the time I bought this unit, I was debating on buying this Streamlight PT2L or a SureFire E2D LED (March 2010). I love SureFire as much as the next guy, but at the end of the day, it came down 'more' to the overall function of what I needed in a light and not the price that drove me to buy the PT2L over the E2D LED.

The E2D LED offers 200 lumens and a strike head bezel. Th 200 lumens is actually an upgrade from the prior E2D LED which was only 120 lumens. I am sure at some point, SureFire will upgrade the lumens even further. The strike head bezel on the E2D LED is the best one on the market. SureFire really made it so that it can be used for tactical purpose. Other manufactures offer ""copy-cat"" designs, but their bezels are made of a pathetic plastic that is more for ""show"" and not built to go. The E2D LED has two outputs: high and low. The material used in the E2D LED like all other SureFire product is exceptional and will withstand abuse. So why did I go with the Streamlight?

The Streamlight PT2L offers 180 lumens (20 less than the SureFire E2D LED). However, the PT2L offers 3 outputs: high, strobe, and low (in that order). The stike head bezel is nice on the E2D LED and it's great for tactical purpose, but it's hard and sharp, so it can scratch other things you might have in your pocket. Also, since I almost, always have my trustworthy Spyderco Stretch with the ZDP189 steel, there's no need for a strike head bezel. The PT2L is also noticeably more compact and lighter. Both the PT2L and E2D LED are waterproof.

Finally as far as cost, which was not the issue for me. I always believe in paying more if I am going to really get more for my money. I purchased the PT2L from Amazon for $42.90. At the time, the SureFire E2D LED was selling for $140 (normally $165). For the price of the E2D LED, I could have bought 3 (or 4) of the PT2L and put one in my car, backpack, and offer the other one to my significant other or family member. I am sure if SureFire bulked up the lumens to 220+ and offers an additional strobe output, I will be the first one all over it. But until then, my PT2L is great.

Also, I forgot to mention, prior to 'needing' to buy a flashlight, I purchased the Streamlight TLR-1s weapon light. Since I cannot carry a weapon light around as an everyday-carry flashlight, I wanted something similar to the quality of my TLR-1s, which I really love. The PT2L was the purfect compliment. Both have similar outputs and lumens: the PT2L has 20 more lumens than the TLR-1s, but the TLR-1s has a stronger center of focus (or so it appears). I hope this helps.",the united states,"March 28, 2011",NLVsd,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:31:10.329534,2020-10-27 22:31:10.534982,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

471,R3CZ1QZ3RGDTNZ,True,Still One Of The Best,"This ProTac is not the smallest, or most feature-filled, or most efficient on the market today. That being said, it has performed reliably for me for almost 2 years now and my mother liked it so much that I ended up getting her one as well recently.

This flashlight is durable, powerful, feels great in the hand, and is a great balance between size and power. The throw from the light is a very bright white (no one would describe it as ""warm"") and its reach is exceptional. I often have to go onto unknown properties at night and this has never let me down.

After almost 2 years of use mine has shown minimal wear, just some marks on the outer case. I have dropped it and gotten it wet and this has not affected its functionality.

The only things I am not in love with are the sheath (I had a leather one made; the nylon one is usable but not my cup of tea) and the fact that it ONLY take CR123A batteries; you cannot put an 18650 in this flashlight like you can on many that have been made since this time.

477,R126YXOOP7PVI4,True,Excessive heat,"-1 star for significant heat production
-1 star for questionable LED protector (front)
-1 star for strobe being second click instead of third

One thing that surprised me was how small this light is. You don't get a fair sense of its size from the stock photos. But it's the perfect size for me so no complaints there.
This light has a powerful beam and great throw. It is so bright on high that I suspect the battery life on that setting would not be good at all.

24 MAR 2013 UPDATE:
After further testing, I have decided that I cannot keep this light. On the high setting, it produces excessive amounts of heat, even a couple inches away from the LED area. The amount of heat is inordinate, and bordering on dangerous. I can see someone getting skin burns from it if used on high for any more than 5 minutes. It doesn't have to be on for long at all before it becomes very hot. Seeing as how I intended to use this light on high for more than a few minutes at a time, it has become a non-option.

484,RRLVB2ZZBYOY5,True,Second one I own,"This is our second Streamlight 2L. Obviously that's an indication of how much I like this flashlight. I carry one and keep the other one bedside. We have critters in our backyard and this flashlight allows me to ""shine"" them. If I want to scare them away, I just double push and activate the strobe option. It startles them and then sends them on their way. The lower lumen feature makes this flashlight a great light for almost anything without using up the batteries.

I've had my first 2L for six months and the batteries are as fresh as when I bought it. Good long life - and I use the light daily.

The triple push button makes this flashlight a bit tricky to get used to. I still don't always get it right the first time. 1 click - brightest. 2 light clicks and push - strobe. 3 light clicks and push - low light (average flashlight).

The 180 lumens (as advertised) is plenty bright for me, and the low lumen is perfect for long-term flashlight needs.

I have purchased countless little flashlights - espec. the little 9 LED, 3 AAA battery ones - and kept them around the house. My 2L replaces them all. The 2L is reliable, easily useable and easy to carry wherever and whenever.

Buy this, and it's all that you'll need. OR - buy two right away. This is one of the best priced flashlights in this catagory of LED lights.

486,RLCYR1LH56B3J,True,Great little product,"Prior to writing this review, I was contemplating whether it deserved a 4-star or a 5-star report. The reason for my dilemma was the switch on it keeps getting bumped on during the regular hustle and bustle of my duties. I finally determined that this problem was due more to my poor choice of a location for mounting it than a defect or design flaw. Therefore it would be wholly unfair to bestow a 4-star review on such a little ""firecracker"" of a flashlight. Be very careful as to the location you chose to mount it, if you mount it on your person, the flashlight gets very hot if the switch is inadvertently bumped on. How they manage to squeeze so much power out of a single CR123A battery is still a mystery to me. I didn't like the fact that it isn't a pinpoint spotlight, but after I had gotten used to its intensity over the larger area, I stopped caring completely. Having 3 different modes on one flashlight has proven very useful as the strobe mode is great for catching the attention of people in an area; the low-intensity mode is good for tactical/administrative; the high intensity, no surprises. I like my larger flashlights for most situations, but I don't always like to carry it around so this is definitely my favorite substitute or backup. It appears to be very well built - feels very solid. It is very small in relative comparison to all my previous portable flashlights - you could just easily loose it somewhere in your TDUs/BDUs. I intentionally lost the holster that was included - a holster for a flashlight that is this small, seriously? If you really wanted to, you could just toss it in your front pocket like a pocket knife. Unless you are prone to easily losing things, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a much smaller flashlight.

487,R1YO0NDUP64XEZ,True,Solid light with flexibility in battery size.,"For the size this is a bright flashlight. Easy to carry with plenty of illumination. I like the looks of it, its feel in my hand, its size, and that you can use several size batteries to power it. It comes with 2 batteries. A CR123A, and an AA. THE CR123A will give the light its max lumens, though the light from the AA is plenty bright. What the manufacturer doesn't tell you is that you can also use a AAA battery in it. It is good to have that flexibility when you need it in an emergency as it ups your chances at finding a battery to keep using it.

It is quite bright. Switch can be a bit awkward at times to figure out...once for brightest light; twice for flashing; 3 times for dim light. After 18 months, I bought a second one to carry with me and put my Streamlight in my car. After nearly 1 year, my new light quit working. I swapped out the batteries with no change. I then swapped out the switch with my old light and WAS able to get the new light working. I wonder if the extreme humidity in a recent Houston trip caused the problem. After waiting a day in lower humidity (St. Louis), playing around with new batteries, and swapping switched (end caps), I was finally able to get the old light to work with its original batteries and switch.

493,RW1Y8SFHYFGAS,True,Super bright if you keep the batteries fresh,"Firstly I bought this light because I saw a Navy Seal recommend a tactical flashlight for personal defense. This light is bright enough to blind someone temporarily (well, technically it could blind someone permanently if left shining in their eyes long enough) and it fits in your pocket, although it's a good size. If someone attacks you, you can strike someone with either edge of this solid flashlight and do some major damage (it has metal ridges on either end and I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of a blow to the head with one of these).

In my opinion this is a better choice than another top brand because this has 100 extra lumens (total 600), it is actually programmable (for example if you want strobe to come up first), and it's even cheaper.

Minus one star because I don't feel it stayed at 600 lumens for long enough (however, I may have received poor batteries with it). I have replaced the batteries with fresh ones (and BAM it's back to lethal-seeming brightness) and I will update the review after using the light if my opinion changes on this point.

At the end of the day, this light will illuminate an entire street (we're talking all the way down a long street) or nearly blow some burglar away with light.

496,R1KE3607JR933Z,True,Good Flashlight,"I have had this flashlight for a few weeks and have loved it. It is very bright, even at considerable distances. I have been able to light up the structure of a bridge (I use it for construction inspection) from a good 30 yards away at night. I don't use the strobe function but it's fun to play with sometimes. With this light in a confined space, the high setting can be too bright so the low setting is very nice to have. Cycling through the modes was fairly intuitive and I was pretty proficient with it after about 5 minutes. It is light, so far has been durable (my 3 y/o nephew wasn't able to damage it even when throwing it around) and a good size to keep in my pocket or on my belt.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, as others have said, it does get warm after a minute or two on the high setting. So far I've only had to use it for that long on the high setting once, and even then it wasn't uncomfortable to hold. I really like this flashlight and am considering buying another as a backup (that doesn't mean I don't have faith in this one but... two is one, one is none).

497,RBS3E53YPRCA7,True,Superb Inexpensive Tactical Light,"When it comes to tactical technology, you can pretty much produce anything and tack the word ""tactical"" to it and most people will buy it. It's a given that the quality tactical items usually come with a hefty price tag. Tactical flashlights are no exception. There are options running in the price range of hundreds of dollars. My quest was to find an alternative to the high priced tactical lights that would take the abuse that I could put it through and continue to survive. Out of the many I examined and used first hand, this Streamlight Protac made the cut. Right out of the package this light felt lightweight yet rigid and sturdy. The extended shell over the switch and lens looks rugged enough to actually use in an emergency situation as suggested by most of the more expensive tactical lights with the same design.
The most noticeable feature of this tactical light is the amount of light the white LED element produces. It's rated at 180 lumen and this is by no means an exaggeration. I've compared it side by side with another tactical light that was about the same price but utilized a zenon bulb and was rated at just over 90 lumen. There was no comparison. The Streamlight literally washed out the light from the other tactical light. I've even compared it to another LED tactical light that was rated at 140 lumen but cost almost twice as much as the Streamlight and it was bright but the Protac was considerably brighter and had a much wider flood.
There are three settings available for this light; one click for full on illumination, two quick clicks for strobe, and three quick clicks for 10 lumen illumination for battery saver mode when only needing a tiny bit of light. The strobe could be useful in a defensive situation if you can make it work. It takes me a few different attempts to get the light to drop into this mode. The 10 lumen illumination made more sense to me for times when I'm camping and only need a small amount of light to show me the way. Battery life seems to be outstanding as I have yet to replace the batteries and the light has been with me on several trips with average usage.
Overall I've used this light for a wide variety of uses and for the money, it's a very good purchase.

Like most pen lights the on/off button is on the end, making it easy to turn on with your thumb. It takes a little practice to get the various modes to easily turn on.

And push 3 times to get the light to go to the low beam. The package has the battery life spelled out for each mode - obviously continuous high beam will burn your battery within several hours.

The end near the light is shaped so that your penlight won't roll away on a flat surface - one of the reason's I chose this model. I have this for my EDC.

I wanted a good quality, small, durable flashlight, so I expected to pay a little more. However, I do think that $28 dollars is quite 'out there' on price.

This is a great tool for home security/inspection, as it blindly lights up any room. As a strobe effect, it will easily disorient any intruder in your home. It's so bright that looking at the light on the floor is enough to cause slight temporary blindness in your own eyes.
In lower power mode, its still very bright, probably as good as any normal flashlight, but obviously using much less power.
The only downside is that I've had to replace the batteries sooner than I expected. I don't have an idea of lifetime, but I'd say that if you left it on full power for about 90 minutes it would probably drain the batteries. The batteries are expensive (123A).

Although the HL 3 costs twice the price of a 2L, you get 4 times the performance.
I conducted a heat test with New batteries. After 7 minutes on High the temp at the hot spot was 99.5 degrees F. I doubt I will ever need it on High for that long, since once you acquire your target at a distance, you can either switch it off or go to Low. I don't see heat as a problem at all.

508,R22AF5NR2NE9TT,True,"Exceptional Performance for Size, Weight, and Price","After a good deal of research I ordered this flashlight (Protac 2L) and have had a few days to assess it. It is very bright - enough so to disorient an attacker in the dark. As a 'premium' light running on CR123A batteries, it easily whoops my other basic LED flashlights in terms of brightness & throw (the others run on 3xAAA and 1xAA). Belt clip is sturdy. Activation button is straightforward, and only took a few minutes to get the hang of (bright - strobe - dim). It is small but not too small - just the right size to fill the palm of one's hand. Included batteries were of the Energizer lithium brand and provide no room for complaint.

This is a great light for EDC or for off-hand use while operating a sidearm with the strong hand. At the price I paid, I couldn't be happier. This light will join me on many adventures for years to come, assuming I don't lose it!

The only thing I'm not enthralled with is the holster. Velcro, nylon, and spandex... just doesn't seem as robust as it should be, considering the quality of the light riding inside of it.

509,R23Z6WGC1Q4Q3R,True,A good have with batteries that will last,"Purchased the Streamlight with 2AA batteries too. I think the advantages of this one are (1) it has a stronger intensity light, (2) one does not have to worry about the batteries leaking during storage in the flashlight. The CR123A batteries have a ten-year battery life so you can keep the flashlight w/batteries in the glove compartment of your car for emergency use. Granted, the batteries are more expensive than the AAs or AAAs, but when you pay so much for a quality flashlight, you don't want the batteries to leak and ruin your flashlight. I have Inova, Fenix, and Streamlight flashlights. The Streamlights are good for the money. I would not say one manufacturer's flashlight is better that the other; its what matters to you as terms of what you regard as important to you in a flashlight.

510,R32P3S9C3MXHWN,True,Super Bright - Perfect Car Flashlight,"Super Bright, quality build. Clip is easily removable. Uses 3 x CA123 (9V), so it's longer than most 2 cell CA123 (6V) flashlights. Perfect for a house, car or tool box, buy a bit too long for a pocket carry.

Would recommend using only SureFire or StreamLight Lithium Batteries, as these batteries are specially designed for flashlights which have a high current drain. Other CA123 batteries are designed for cameras, not flashlights. Avoid no name brand batteries. I bought this flashlight with 12 Streamlight batteries, but I also use Surefire batteries - both are good.

Regular D-Cell Flashlight batteries contain water, which will freeze in your car during the winter. CA123 Batteries are rated to -40°, and have a shelf life of 10 years. This is the best kind of flashlight for a car or truck.

512,RWWQQI12Q00RT,True,Best light I have owned,Since my military police days throughout the 1990's I have been a fan of Streamlight. This LED light has rekindled that opinion for me. This is not a cheap light but it is well worth the cost. Amazingly bright! Strobe function is great for personal / home protection as it will dissonant an intruder and illuminate them at the same time. I keep one of these in my night stand next to my pistol at all times. Battery life is not super long on high power (about 1 hour continuous) but long enough and it maintains brightness. Use low beam setting for extended use to preserve battery life dramatically (to about 18 hours). Did i mention the high setting is crazy bright?!

514,R1IEZOPU6TBE4X,True,"Great light, better value","I've only had this light for a week, but it's proved itself to me already. I'm currently using the hook and loop attached holster that came with the light. The combo is very comfortable for EDC and is so light I hardly know it Is there. Access is fast, albeit a little noisy due to the hooks being removed from the loops. The light draws well for me. I haven't used and have no intent to use the clip. The clip is tight on the light's frame out of the box, and I could see it staying that way without frequent use. However with frequent use I'd have to believe any clip would loosen up.

Someone else mentioned it is or was almost too small for their hand. I'm 6' 240lbs with big hands. I can hold and operate the light with no issues. Any shorter though and the back of my palm would fold in front of the lens. Of course everyone is different so ymmv.

The light is plenty bright enough for pretty much any use I can think of. Use of the strobe and low beam settings were easy to adjust to accessing after a few trial runs getting the feel of the switch. The construction material is a quality metal. Time will tell how it holds up to EDC but I have high hopes. Battery door is sealed with an o-ring to keep dirt and moisture out. I haven't run down the included battery yet, but I have replacements on order. So far I've mostly used it on the brightest setting off and on so I expect to replace it about once a month.

521,R2221MO5HZLB0N,True,Good but eats batteries fairly quickly,"I have had this flashlight for about a year now.

PROS:
Sturdy - I can be pretty harsh on my equipment but has held up well even on multi-day hikes.
Bright - The brightest setting when on new batteries can illuminate paths well 100+ meters and while I have never needed the strobe light, it is fairly disorienting.
Low-Mode - The low mode is more than sufficient for most tasks that do not involve fast moving objects as it is really a super fast pulsing strobe light.

CONS:
Battery usage: A week of light use with the occasional High Beam seems to do the batteries in, while still powered the drop in performance is very noticeable.

Verdict:
I definitely like the make and brightness of the flashlight but in the future I would get something that is either rechargeable or without such a drop off in brightness.

524,R10G29K1O0BQR1,True,Perfect EDC flashlight,"I. LOVE. THIS. FLASHLIGHT.

I have a Surefire E2D Defender that I like but just doesn't put out enough light and LED conversion bulbs are insanely expensive for something so small. I bought a pelican LED flashlight to try and make up for the lack of light output, however, for requiring two 123As the light output on the pelican was worse than my Defender. I ditched that quick and did some research. I've never owned a streamlight but I have heard amazing things. So I took a chance with this ProTac 1L-1AA. This flashlight is amazing, the size is perfect and the light output is perfect, not too bright and the ability to choose between bright or dim. I use the dim setting quite often at work as this flashlight is carried daily. The description claims you'll get a higher lumen output with the lithium.

I also have a Streamlight on my pistol and have a little tiny Streamlight on my rifle. I prefer the small one on my rifle because it is light-weight and I can swing my rifle onto moving targets faster. Not that I actually swing my rifle onto moving targets, but less mass near the end of the barrel means less inertia to overcome and less energy required to bring the weapon to bear on moving targets. That equals faster target acquisition for targets out to 20 yards or so, which will be normal in close-combat (inside and around a house).

I've given probably a hundred 4 and 5 star reviews and only a handful of bad. I only used this flashlight a few times and it worked for less than 2 months. It's dead. Of course the ""window"" has closed for me to exchange it to Amazon so I had to call Streamlight direct. They told me to go on their website, fill out a service request and mail it to them and they will repair it. A big pain in the rear. I have thrown items away rather than go through this hassle. But for $87, I have no choice but to waste my time finding a box and stuffing and since my printer is down, go to the library to print the label, then off to the post office to spend more money mailing it to them.

I have a lot of flash lights and this is my first and last Streamlight purchase. A GREAT company would mail you a new one and tell you to send the broken one back. A good company would at least mail you a return box and label for shipping. I have 5 Surefires that I paid $2 to $8 for, are just as bright, and have never let me down. My expectation is much greater for the price of this light and reputation of this company but it failed the basics by simply not working. Then, they don't make it easy to exchange.

I refused to buy a SureFire, because at the time, I wasn't made of money, and don't really like hype. But in an endless quest to find the brightest and affordable flashlight, someone finally came out with a product that you really can't beat for the money.

1. A very bright, very white light. I'm not sure what the light temperature is in terms of Kelvin, but it is a very white light. For me, that is important. I like 6500K. It is the color of daylight. Warm lights are nice, and have their place... they provide a very relaxing environment for your eyes, especially when reading at night. 6500K is not that light. It pierces the darkenss and the colors of the objects are the same with your light as they were in the day when you were outdoors.

2. The 10-tap programming is excellent. If you are using this in a tactical situation, accidentally toggling through a strobe mode is, at best, inconvenient. At worst, you've befuddled yourself. I have at least two of these lights, and I keep one on HIGH only, and the other on LOW-HIGH. If you're the the opposite end of the flashlight for the bad guy, you get full power. If its the flashlight I keep in my pack, LOW-HIGH allows me long battery life and the ability to read a document without blinding myself.

3. Lifetime warranty. A lot of other companies do not offer this, and that is a shame. Kudos to Streamlight for standing by their product.

5. The size means it is easy to hold and use. The button placement is perfect, and it will not slip easily from your hand. The bezel is slightly crenelated, so a whack to your assailant would hurt, but it is not so aggressive as to tear you up accidentally.

6. Too big for your jeans. Unless you like that awkward look and feel.

7. Not as durable as an ElZetta, which is a better weapon-mounted light. They are virtually indestructible, but not as white.

8. Good beam pattern, with a definite hot spot in the center.

9. You cannot ""stare it down."" I don't care who you are. If this light is pointed in your eyes, you will flinch, and it hurts.

10. I really wish it could would be compatible with a pressure switch they already make, to make it more feasible as a weapon-mounted light. But that is simply icing.

11. Buy one. Or three.",the united states,"February 2, 2014",Gryphon,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:31:40.492368,2020-10-27 22:31:40.606067,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

533,R376VTARB6MEMU,True,Unbeatable Value!,"This fantastic flashlight really delivers in three important areas:
1) Compact and Bright. It has 600 lumens on high! This is amazing for a light that fits in my pocket. 2) Adequate low setting.

It is twice as bright as the Surefire low setting - which cannot be comfortably be used for night walking, in my opinion. 3) Self-Defense.

543,R3C0GS5IQCYZ13,True,"Perfect EDC tactical light, my trusted companion","This has recently became my EDC tactical light. I especially like the double-tap-to-strobe functionality of the rear power button. Perfect for diffusing an escalating or threatening situation. The anti-roll casing is also ideal for drop scenarios. Clip is pleasantly sturdy without being too rigid -- clipping this within my back pocket is easy enough, and I trust the clip will keep it there. Size of this light is perfect (the exact width of my palm when held in hand) -- small enough to remain comfortably concealed, large enough to avoid feeling like I'm trying to wield a child's toy. Brightness and focal coverage of the beam is spot on for intended use -- light packs a punch, but at a cost. Full brightness on one CR123 lasts about an hour.

549,R2YQRJIPRFC665,True,"Great ""Tactical"" light that's easy to carry at a decent price.","I have a Fenix L10D, L2D, and a P3D that are great utility lights, but the Streamlight 2L is an excellent Tactical light because of the very bright intensely focused beam, and especially with the functionality of an effective momentary-on switch. The incredibly powerful Fenix TK series tactical lights are just too big (and expensive) to carry everyday and their old L1T is underpowered in comparison.

With my particular Fenix lights you fully depress the switch then half press to cycle through the different modes. On the Streamlight you essentially do the opposite and half press the tail cap to cycle through the modes and then fully depress the button to click and select it.

In tactical use with the 2L you can quickly pull the light out and immediately it will blind a person at the highest output by a simple half press of the tail cap. A second half press will emit a disorienting strobe with the third press is at the lowest setting.

The size of the light is perfect, not too small and not too big, and easily secured in my front pants pocket with a detachable clip. The only improvements I would like is more aggressive knurling on the body for a better grip and less artifacts in the quality of the beam.

I've been using the 2L with rechargeable Tenergy LiFePO4 CR123A batteries which has been working well with this light so far.

When I first approach a vehicle that I stop, I double tap the switch so that I'm on high beam. I guarantee that everyone in that car who tries to look at me on my approach is completely blinded by this light. It's powerful. Once I have all hands in sight and my problem areas are controlled, I tap it down to the low beam so I don't blind myself with the reflections from DL and paperwork. It's nice having two options available. It has a little metal clip on it so I can hang it on my shoulder when taking notes. I'd highly recommend buying a pack of batteries though (Streamlight 85177 CR123A Lithium Batteries, 12-Pack) because it's not rechargeable. It takes two of those batteries, and I think they last me about a month or two before needing to be replaced.

Pros.

562,R34HHZ2UBHSKIK,True,Great Light- Works well as a shoulder light for LEOS,"I picked this light up after one of my friends showed me how well it works as a hands-free shoulder light for law enforcement officers. The light clips onto your microphone tabs on your uniform and is easy to activate with your support hand when needed.

The different levels take a bit of practice to get used to, but after a little practice you will be able to activate the low beam with ease. The low beam is perfect for writing down info in low-lit areas while keeping both hands free of a larger flashlight. The low beam is also good for checking if someone's pupils show equal dilation when exposed to light.

The high beam is bright enough to serve as a duty flashlight if needed. I would not recommend use of this light as your only duty flashlight, but it makes a great backup light. The included pouch is small and easily fits on a duty belt.

The strobe is bright and disorientating when shined in someone's fact, but I cannot see myself using the strobe feature very often.

After I used the light for a few nights, 2 co-workers said they had to have one! :)

564,R22TJN7UCBXUT2,True,Great flashlight,"Bright, sturdy, compact, and easy to operate! I chose this flashlight after considering several models from Streamlight and other manufacturers. This one has the simple operation I wanted: One click = bright light. I doubt I will ever have use for the strobe feature, but the dim option will no doubt be handy. The pocket clip and belt pouch are both nice features, and the former can be flipped around on the flashlight so you can clip it to a baseball cap brim for a quick headlamp alternative.

Potential concerns:
I don't know how accurate the battery life rating might be, because I just got the thing, and I don't want to run down the batteries just to find out. The packaging information doesn't seem to rule out rechargeable batteries, but doesn't specifically say that they're OK either. The pouch included has a wide enough belt loop for web gear and other very wide belts, almost too wide in fact for a standard belt.

*edit* I'm bumping this up from 4 starts to 5. I haven't found another decent sub-$40 light anywhere else. Are there brighter lights out there? Yes, but they're either a lot more expensive, or not as well made.

That worked, then the clip started to bend outwards and one day it fell out of my pocket and it's gone for good. Had they made the clip stronger and thicker I wouldn't have lost it because everyday I still have my knife on me in the same pocket with no issues.

Also the button required a lot of strength to activate it. Great because the light never turned on in my pocket but bad because I felt if I had to turn it on when I needed it the most I would probably fail.

This light has been with me in the city, out camping, illuminated dark dirt roads in the middle of Wyoming, been dropped more times than I can count, and has survived all I thrown at it so far.

I love the multiple modes this has, the outstanding price for the capability, and the fact that I can carry this in just about any pocket of any pair of pants I own easily.

The light output with a CR123 is very impressive because it's a 3V lithium. I am even likely to buy lithium AA batteries for the notably longer battery life.

I am very impressed. The switch takes getting used to if you want to use the low power setting (don't really expect to use that). On mine I usually have to click 5 times when the instructions say 4. Otherwise it's sturdy, super bright and very handy.

At this point the only possible downside is the battery and I might consider getting versions that use AA/AAA or more standard battery from the same company. We'll see how long this one lasts so it might be a non issue considering I used to buy 5x D cells for the mag.

585,R1MJLU3VEG62ND,True,"Small in size, big in light","I first heard about this light while reading a law enforcement publication. The entire back page of their technology section was devoted to this light. After reading the article, I continued to search more about the light on YouTube and other internet sites.

As a law enforcement officer, I had been carrying the same Streamlight since the early 90’s. It has served me well, and I have never had a problem with it, and only had to change the battery packs twice over the years. I also have a Surefire light that I had received as a Christmas gift years ago, which I know cost almost $200.00. However with the low list price and the big hype of lumens, I went for it and purchased the light. I am happy I did.

When I received the light, I played with the programming and adjusted it to the Low/High setting. This works great, as it can be used it in the car to look for dropped items and into my duty bag without blinding me. I used it on the low setting most of the time, however when you need the big lumens, just double tap the switch and ON WITH THE BIG LIGHT!

While the beam cannot be focused, it is very bright and really floods the area. Every time to turn on the high beam in a dark area, I always get the same response from other officers, “holly cow (yes, cleaned up for Amazon) what the heck do you got there?”

I have since purchased five more for my family and as gifts. I also know six officers that have purchased one after seeing mine in action. I should be getting a free one from Streamlight for all the sales I have provoked!

Would I like to see it in a re-chargeable battery, sure, but I find that batteries last several month of normal use.

And sadly, that was main thing I was looking for. I wanted a compact, durable, replaceable-battery penlight for pupil exams. I have yet to find one that isn't too bright.

That being said I don't know of any other light with as much bang for the buck. It's feature rich, plenty of lumens and it seems to be built solid and it only takes 2 cr123. I carry it everyday in my front pocket using its clip. I use it around the deer lease and I feel confident I could use it to clear a building as it is plenty bright. Can't go wrong for an everyday light for around 50-60$. I originally purchased the smaller 1L and it was plenty bright but I found it to small for my hands to use effectively while holding a pistol and clearing rooms.

605,R25D5WQEI1R6PO,True,"Awesome, will be buying another one soon.","I like the tail cap switch. The HL 5 has more lumens, but unless your trying to broil or crisp meat, the HL 4 has plenty of lumens and the tail cap switch. One of the programmable setting has about four settings of low to high. This is good because the high setting will obscure your night vision if you are not ready for it. If you blast it on high in dark buildings, a reflection off of a mirror or picture glasswork blind you momentarily. However, outside the high string is awesome. Very beefy feeling I n your hand.

606,R11RPI74TLSA25,True,Fantastic light,"AWESOME LIGHT. Just received this light and tested it. It comes with both a CR123A battery, as well as a quality AA battery. Both batteries inserted into the light without issue. Upon inserting the AA, there is a small amount of spring pressure put on the battery in order to close the tail cap, however, it is a non issue.

I tried the CR123A battery first and the light worked perfectly. The high setting is very bright with a good hot spot and plenty of spill. Very few, if any, artifacts can be spotted in the beam. The strobe and low setting also worked fine with just the right amount of light on the low setting.

I then inserted the AA battery. I was actually taken back on how much light was produced with a AA battery on high. Visually, it appeared very similar to the amount of light the lithium battery produced. Low and strobe also worked fine.

The light is very well made and should give you no problems. Streamlight has excellent customer service, so if you do have any problems, they are willing to stand by their products, from my experience.

I would not hesitate to purchase several of these lights, as the ""duel fuel"" capability is the best selling point of this model.

If you are looking for a great light, do not hesitate to purchase this one.",the united states,"June 19, 2016",biggy,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:32:24.272324,2020-10-27 22:32:24.398216,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

612,RKCDZRU198L2I,True,Perfect for EDC,"I wanted a small light with a simple user interface for pocket carry and the Streamlight Protac 1L fills that role perfectly. About the size of a glue stick, this small light puts out a surprising amount of light. The beam is relatively narrow, mainly due to the reflector, but it is perfectly adequate for a light this size.

The light comes on HIGH with the first tap, STROBE with a double tap, and LOW with a triple tap. Anyone used to double-clicking a mouse will be familiar with the type of action needed to change modes. The forward clicky switch is recessed, so this light can tailstand. The bezel has very minor crenelations, not nearly enough to be uncomfortable in a pocket, but enough to make it unpleasant for a person to get hit with.

613,RMBRCWK17GQM3,True,Best high-output light I've tried,"I've been a Streamlight fan for a while now, and decided to expand my collection to include one of their HL series lights. I specifically wanted to have an alternative high-output option when out walking my dogs at night. Although I wear a SureFire Minimus on night walks and always have a Streamlight PT1L on my person, I wanted something with more power and tactical functionality, especially for threat scenarios. This thing is BRIGHT, and sports the same double-tap-to-strobe function that I love so much on my PT1Ls and PT2Ls. Very pleased with the comfort, function, output and durability of the 88040 as I am with all my Streamlight products. Highly Recommended.

It is bright when you need it to be, but you can conveniently use the low setting to conserve battery power. The push button is great. A lot softer than on the streamlight stylus pro, but it still takes enough travel to not turn on when you don't want it to. My only complaint with this light is the clip. The very first time (and every subsequent time for that matter) I tried to put it in my pocket, the clip launched off. This wouldn't be a big deal, but I have already lost lights because of crappy clips. Its nice to have a removable clip for those who don't want it, but it comes off far to easy.

It is like having a spotlight in your hand. Almost as bright as a car highbeam headlight. Worked well when I was hunting for an electrical connector in the storage compartment of my trailer at night.

Updated 09/07/13: Light is still bright as ever, but the negative thing I found was after leaving it on for about 4 minutes while working under the truck dash on some wiring, the casing became quite hot, I assume from the bulb heat.

Now, admittedly I am not the most handiest guy around--two left thumbs as a matter of fact, so I have never utilized this light in all of its formats. Reason: I'm agile enough to turn it on or off (applause!) but when it comes to its other assets, such as acting in a strobe mode, it has never worked for me--it's to darn difficult to get it into the position it should be in. However, my son who is a mechanical and engineering genius, tried it for a minute or two and was able to repeat the motions each time he tried in the same strobe condition. So a word to the wise--if you are seeking a high lumen light simply to turn on and off, this may not be the guy for you. But if you are in the high tech mode and find mechanical things easy to work out, this unit should work fine for you.

624,RZ19NAOW1UAAA,True,Not Really a Tactical Light,"The light is bright and has better than average throw without too narrow a beam, but the switching layout isn't something that lends itself to intuitive law enforcement operation. It's probably best to program it for high brightness operation only if LE is its intended purpose. Furthermore, the low setting is achieved via pulse width modulation and the switching (flickering) is painfully obvious - very poorly designed. The brightness step down routine is necessary to preserve battery life and is done reasonably well compared to other lights at the same price point, but if used for more than 6-15 minutes continuously the light effectively becomes a 600 lumen light.

625,R1FH7F5TRZ7WNP,True,my new favorite light,"I own four different lights from streamlight, that being said this is by far my favorite. this casts farther and brighter than the stylus pro, there is about as much difference between this and the stylus as there is, in brightness between the microstream compared to the stylus pro. the low mode is almost exactly the same as the nano. and the bright is 2 times brighter than the stylus pro. the strobe is very powerful given the size of this light. it is well worth the upgrade from the stylus pro. if you are skeptical about buying this and have never owned any streamlight product, I suggest spending 7 dollars on the nanolight, once you see how bright that little inch and a quarter light is you will definitely want to upgrade to a microstream,stylus or protac 2 aaa. It will amaze you how bright and efficient these lights, that you can stick in you pocket and not really notice you are carrying are. if you want something that works, lasts and isn't gonna break you, go with any streamlight.

I'm in pretty good shape, lift a bit, and work with my hands, so anyone else feeling frustrated by the inherent stiffness in the switch should not feel alone, lame, etc.

This relatively simple/free modification did wonders for making mine easier to operate:

Get an office/school supply type hole puncher - single or three hole doesn't matter - and an unused business card, as that weight paper is more convenient.
Punch out a few 'holes' from the card and save the little confetti circles the punch makes.
With a standard size hole puncher, they're a perfect size for what you're about to do.
Unscrew the very back cap that covers the switch, flip that cover over, and insert a few of the punchouts into the circular recess in the rubber switch cover.

For reference, mine works MUCH better with four pieces inserted.
I suppose regular paper would work too, but you'd obviously need more punchouts.

643,R3U4FJAKQJNUZZ,True,Great Value,"I bought this flashlight for EDC (and on a budget) and have carried it around in my pocket for the last 3 months. It's very bright - brighter than I expected. When I show people how bright it is, they have all been very surprised. I think that the operation of this light is way simpler than some of the other reviewers. It has a half-push and a full-click (think focusing a digital camera, half-push, and taking a picture with it, full-click) that is very fast and reliable in my use so far. The strobe feature is awesome, and after trying it out on myself in a mirror I can say that it is VERY disorienting. The low-level light is also great, and is the mode I use the most. A lot of the time I don't need a blasting bright light, but do need just a little illumination, and this light is great for that.

There are 2 reasons for 1 star deduction. The first is that the batteries do in fact rattle around inside the flashlight, which is really just a minor annoyance. The second point and the only thing I really dislike about this light is the clip. I really wish this light had a low-ride type of clip. If I clip this light in my pocket like I do my pocket knife, the top sticks way out, and I don't like that. I wish it could ride below the top of the clip, so it would disappear into my pocket.

644,ROUHKCM7TE1NH,True,Pretty impressed but one small issue. Would give 4.5* if I could,"No adjustable focus, but even so it reaches farther than a different light I have that was the same price. Bought this because other light gave me some issues and I spent too much time messing with it. That light was great when I could get it working right, but even without counting quality as a factor, this one is definitely better.
*Very bright
*Feels durable, haven't dropped it on anything hard but would probably hold up fine
*Gets slightly warm, but not hot like others have said. I don't usually use it on high for too long though, and it is winter so it's colder to start out than usual
***

652,R1D7K47CJO1ISA,True,Best flashlight yet.,"I walk at night. A few years ago, when I started to walk, I looked for a lightweight and bright flashlight. Up to then I used a 4 D cell Mag-Light. It was a club. I picked up a 90 lumen off the shelf flashlight at my local Wal-Mart. It did the job, but I wanted more light. At Home Depot I found a 200 lumen light that was even smaller and lighter. Unfortunately, it wouldn't stay on for more than 15 - 20 seconds before flickering itself to darkness. I sent it back to the manufacturer for repair or replace. The same light came back with the same problem. So, after some online research, I decided to spend a little more and ordered the Streamlight. The extra cost was worth it. Under high power night becomes day (exaggeration)! It floods whatever you point it at with bright white light. The strobe will attract attention from a mile or more away plus it can temporarily incapacitate (blind) anyone attempting negative behavior that looks at it. Low power is bright enough to be useful without becoming a battery killing beacon. A holster is supplied with an interesting feature - it can be removed without taking off my belt.

I can't comment on longevity yet. Other than that, I recommend the Streamlight 88040 ProTAC HL High Lumen Professional Tactical Light.

It's a perfect size, puts out a quite a bit of light and has excellent build quality. I've had this for two years and the black body has some dings and scratches, but in not way do they compromise it's functionality. There are a couple of features that I love about this light. First off, the clip is excellent. It has good retention and isn't prone to snagging. I also love the switch on this light. The pressure on the switch is just right for me (enough to where I won't accidentally turn it on), and I love the tap features that cycle it between high/strobe/low beams.

I'll say it again, the size is just perfect in my opinion. It rides perfectly in a shirt pocket or pants pocket.

667,R16T6AQOD2Q9H4,True,Very bright and practical,"This is a very good compact handheld light. It is very small and lightweight, surprisingly bright for it's size, and has a good battery life, especially when used sparingly on high. I use it as my house light and got about two months of use out of the batteries it came with. I realize many of the current crop of flashlights offer much higher lumen ratings, but also eat the batteries twice as fast. On high, this light illuminates out to about a hundred yards (very bright), and on low,about thirty. The low setting is good for moving around the house or walking outside when you don't want to lose your night vision. The light can be set on it's end and used as a candle, which would be handy in a tent or during a power outage. The tailcap switch interface is easy to use, although I wish it had the ten tap programming of it's big brother, the Protac HL.

Also, it's bright. Like, really bright. As in, you blind your self bright if you look at the LED on full power. It does have a nice split between being a flood and a beam light. It has a nice wide pattern, but the central beam will go forever.

I've had a surplus of CR123 batteries from an old LED light that doesn't get used anymore, so I went looking for a newer-generation light that runs off the 3V lithium cells. The Streamlights have always been great to me, and this one was really affordable. When I powered it up, the light brightened up the whole room!

It is very bright - I was very pleased at how far I could see with it. I do find it a little difficult to toggle btw the settings from high beam to strobe. It is a series of very fast taps and then holding the button to lock in the mode. The button is on the tail end so you have to hold it in your palm with your thumb on the button. After much practice - I am able to get it to change.

680,R1DNXB1420O0K7,True,Great pocket flashlight,"I purchased this flashlight to replace an old Browning flashlight that I have been carrying for almost ten years. The directions say to only use Streamlight, Panasonic, Sanyo, Energizer or Duracell batteries in this light. However I use rechargeable Ultrafire CR123 batteries and have no issues with them.

PROS
-Price
-Very strong, sturdy construction
-Lives up to its 180 lumen tagline
-Excellent blend of throw and flood

I compared this light to a Novatec SPL-120 (120 Lumen) and the Streamlight outshines it by a good margin.

CONS
-The pocket clip comes off too easily. Too many times I have been clipping it to a pocket to have the clip come off in my hand. Securing it with a screw instead of a clamp around the light would be better
-The flashlight does get a little warm near the reflector after being on for 15 minutes or more. Not enough to burn your hand but enough to notice.
-The programming takes a little getting used to, even if you read the directions. In the end you will spend a few minutes figuring out how to switch it from high to strobe to low.

I checked the impact resistance and the despite the feel, the E12 had 1M less of a drop resistance than the ProTac. I dropped the protac on concrete accidentally and not a mark was left.

697,R24INCPKXZN8DD,True,Most durable light ever! Buy this!,"This is absolutely one of the best small flashlights you can buy. It's the size of a pen or a marker, but gives an incredible amount of light. Great combination of light being spread out, to be able to see plenty around you, but also focused in the middle of the beam so it has a great range to it. Lumens mean nothing if they aren't focused right, and this focuses them perfectly. It can slip into your pocket and you'll hardly notice it there. Powered by AAA batteries, so no need to buy expensive batteries like some flashlights. Simple AAA. The clip can be moved to any place on the narrow part of the body, and turned any way you want it. I used it as a head lamp by turning the clip around and putting it on the bill of a hat. Perfect for dark mornings on the farm when greasing tractors before the day starts.

SPEAKING OF FARM WORK.....the real reason I came on here to write this review is because sometime last fall I dropped this flashlight in a cornfield when I was chainsawing trees on a fence line. One day it wasn't in my pocket next to my knife, like it usually was. I figured I lost it, and would just buy a new one. I was sad cuz this light was awesome! Here's the crazy part...I (luckily) accidentally left some branches in the field, and when my boss was planting THE FOLLOWNG SPRING, (yes, that's about 5 months later) he hopped out of the tractor to throw the branches off the field, and happened to look down, and hey, there is my Streamlight ProTac 2AAA sitting in the dirt. He picked it up and it turned right on, no hesitation, no problem.. This thing sat in the dirt, snow, rain, mud, and who knows what else for 5 months! And it still works as if brand new! This is not to mention the countless drops on concrete floors, rolling over on the ground with it in my pocket, (while doing vehicle maintenance/mechanic work) cold/hot, you name it, this thing works like its new. Its a bit scratched up now but no rust and still throwing out as much light as ever.

Also, a lot of the one-star reviews for this said that its hard to press the switch. No idea what they're talking about, mine is fine and normal. Strobe mode and low light mode are easy to get to, just a simple half press to get to them.

All that to say, one crazy year and a half later after purchasing this light, it has more than proven itself as a durable, bright, convenient, small but awesome flashlight. Every time I ever need a flashlight in the future, it will be a Streamlight.

703,R2HDD9YEFK8M8C,True,Great flashlight for LE work as well as mounting to a tactical rifle,"I purchased this light mainly for the option of mounting it to my AR that I carry for use on my department's SWAT team. We seldom use long guns while typically only carrying our Glock 22s, which I have a Streamlight TLR1s mounted (yet another great streamlight product). However, in the event I need something for long range, my AR is ready.

This flashlight has 3 functions, and they all work superb. I am extremely happy with the programming of the led as well. I leave it on default but love that you can change it to fit your style.

If I am not mistaken, this thing also comes with a lifetime warranty. WOW!

The construction is great. It feels nice and rugged. I have no concerns of using this light in the line of duty. Furthermore, the fact it takes 123s is perfect. I have had bad experiences with rechargeables and would much rather replace them with disposables.

What am I thinking?! I can't believe I waited this long to talk about the strength of the LED. Boy, this sucker is bright!!! You can't look at this thing in daylight, much less in the pitch black. While camping the other night, I shined this baby into a tree about 150 foot tall and could see the entire canopy of the tree as bright as day.

The only negative this flashlight has is the lack of a mountable pressure switch. I ordered this baby thinking the regular streamlight remote would work but read several other pages that it would not. I have not tried it, but I do not want to be out the cash if it doesn't. Maybe streamlight will remedy this. Since it was my own fault when I didn't thoroughly research my decision, I will not discount the flashlight's rating.

710,R3828T22PDI5GE,True,Great flashlight !!!,"I have it on me 24/7 and use it a lot. The only problem I have had with it, is when its used on HI for more then 5 min, it gets very hot. So hot its almost impossible to hang onto. On HI it will light up any room and can light up anything 75 yards away, and the strobe is better then any other flashlight I own. It is a very well made product, I would buy another one if this one grew legs.

Update: The battery's don't last long when used daily. To save money on battery's I replaced it with the Protac 1AA. That light uses 1 AA battery. Its less then half as many Lumen but is better then most multi-cells ive used. I have been using it for over a month on the same AA battery.

732,R26KL1CFGHS2RI,True,This little light of mine....,"I would have to rank this as one of the best purchases I've ever made. I've become so used to carrying it that I will go back to get it if I forgot it at home. It really messes up my day, if I don't have it with me. The reason being, is that it is very useful. Even during the day, it is powerful enough to be utilized. If a ""lady"" drops her keys under the table or sofa, you can be Johnny-on-the-spot with your Streamlight.
I am licensed to carry a handgun. I believe if you carry a gun you need to carry a tactical flashlight. You have to see what you're shooting at, and to blind and confuse ""the bad guy"". This Streamlight ProTac 2L is perfect for that. It's strong points are extreme brightness for its size, strobe feature, pocket clip and extreme light weight. I carried a Surefire for years that is 1/3 as bright and 3x the weight. This product is so light that you can ""wear"" it with anything. You don't even feel it on you, but it's there when you need it. The positives;

1. Very bright, extremely bright!! 3x brighter than the Surefire Tactical flashlights that have been used for years. (when I show it to people the first thing they want to do is to shine it into their friend's eyes, as a joke. I stop then because this can cause permanent eye damage)
2. The strobe feature is very useful. I used it coming out of a high school football game. We were crossing the street and a car was coming at us at a pretty fast rate. I aimed my Streamlight about 5 feet in front of me and hit the strobe. The car hit the brakes and slowed down (he probably thought I was police). Also used it to disorient dogs that have got too close.
3. The low power feature is best when you don't want to attract too much attention and to conserve battery life.
4. Battery life is deceptively short lived. I say that because I go through lots of batteries. I say deceptively, because I use it a lot. So, all in all, battery life is very, very good.

This product has very few negatives that, to be fair, it was not designed to do in the first place;
1. There is no free lunch, the small size of the lens and mirror does not give you a nice, sharply focused beam. Still, it is very bright and has a good amount of lumination to the surrounding area. It is best used, and I feel it was designed for, short range.
2. Due to its lightweight, it is not in the Surefire's league when it comes to durability and level of waterproof. Again, not something I feel it was designed to do.

All in all an awesome product.

735,R2JRKNY74TW9NG,True,Downright Amazing.,"Rarely do I gush on a product. You never really appreciate a nice flashlight until you REALLY need one, and I have put these little buggers through their paces. I have used them to hunt by on my shotguns/rifles in the black of night, carry them in the car for emergencies and have used them time and time again camping. I've had these in the rain, dropped them in the lake (not waterproof, but man it's nice that they don't sink immediately), thrown it at an aggressive dog (don't ask), the list goes on...

The battery life for power ratio is one of the most attractive aspects to these lights. I have since purchased 2 other Streamlight products, the entire line seems to be professional grade.

736,R7OSLVA1LOJ8I,True,"Portable Sun, but not necessarily a good thing","I picked this up just before Christmas on a Lightning deal on a whim. I already have a Stinger LED, an old-school Stinger converted to a Lite Pipe, and Protac 2AA, so I have no practical use for this thing, but i'm an admitted flashaholic, so whatevers. The first time I turned this thing on, it immediately caused a giggle fit. In broad daylight it was enough to blind me off the reflection from the hardwood floor.

GOOD: It's bright. Really bright. Insanely bright. Easily reaches several hundred feet. My other flashlights can blind, but I believe this thing could actually kill someone. Five stars just for how stupid bright it is.

BAD: Everything else. It's too bright to use in any kind of up close work except on low power. Any reflection off a shiny surface blinds you. I'm honestly afraid it might hurt someones eyes. The pocket clip is pointless, the head is as big as the stinger led, there's no way you could stick it in a normal human pocket. It takes uncommon CR123 camera batteries, which are like $2 each.

If you want a pocket flashlight go with one of the smaller Protacs. My 2AA is plenty bright enough for any task, it fits in my pocket, runs for a month with heavy use, and is a bit cheaper. If you want a bright, outdoorsy light, look into the HP series. If you want something to signal Mars, or burn the flesh off a vampire at 1000 yards, get a HL-3. For me, i'll keep it in the glovebox of my car as an emergency light.

I've already dropped it once and it still works fine. Also, I've decided to carry it in my pocket daily as a non-lethal deterrent. This thing will completely blind anyone within a few feet and it is so bright it is irritating when flashed in your eyes. I can easily light up a house roughly 75 meters from my balcony. It's not a flood light but it is very effective! Especially, the strobe at close range. I've seen guys in airsoft use less powerful lights at 50 meters and it becomes extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact location of your combatant when being 'strobed' .

740,REM1KZL7D202W,True,Immaculate,"I had been following this flashlight since it's announcement and eagerly ordered it from Amazon once it was available. 600 lumens had always sounded appealing, but I never quite appreciated just how bright that is until I got my hands on this puppy. From 50 yards away you can temporarily blind someone of their night vision, get closer and it will disorient them even more. The bottom line is this: don't shine it at another person unless you really need to do so. Even with your eyes closed, this light will leave you seeing white halos for a 15-20 seconds if it is shined directly at you from close range.

Being in the fire department, this light is very handy for finding just about anything you lose, whether it be a tool in the middle of a house or a needle in a haystack, this flashlight will illuminate everything for you to see. The three function switch is handy, sometimes you don't need all 600 lumens to see what you're doing, and so simply tap three times and press the button in all the way. The beam is straight, with a little spread, but not adjustable. It is still incredible all of this power comes from just one LED.

Pros: sturdy, lightweight, easy to hold, packs a powerful punch, waterproof.
Cons: Goes through batteries like a sieve. 600 lumen output for the first 50 or so minutes of new batteries, then it rapidly decreases. Buy rechargeable batteries to use for this light, and you will be a happy camper. Otherwise I have no complaints. If you want what is easily the coolest and best flashlight for about $70, then look no farther. You will not be disappointed.

One final note, the low power mode does indeed flash the led at a hertz level faster than the human eye can see. The previous review was correct about how this could be potentially dangerous if examining machinery at night, since it could appear to spin backwards, or not moving at all. But I have experienced no issues with this.

768,R35LB6ECTPT6XC,True,Best bang for your buck! and much better than the HL,"I was a bit hesitant to buy this flashlight at first because the Protac HL was priced exactly the same but offered 600 lumens. The reason I ended up sticking with the Protac 2L was for two main reasons. 1. This flashlight is small! It was much smaller than i anticipated and is perfect for edc. I'd rather have a 260 lumen light on my person than a 600 lumen one in my car or at home. I personally think the HL might not be best suited for edc becuase its bezel much larger and doesnt feel ""right"" in my pocket with an awkward bulge. Secondly, I believe that 260 lumens is very bright for my needs and would prefer the longer run time the 2L offers to a 600 lumen light. Also, if I needed to draw my weapon that did not have weapon mounted light and needed to clear my house/building or whatever, 260 lumens is plenty.

I dont want to sound like im hating on the Protac HL. By all means its a great light but I just think for EDC the 2L is a much better option and will give you much more run time--saving $$$ in battery costs.

Both Streamlight and Surefire are great quality, and although Streamlights are made in China, apparently they are able to exercise at least some quality control. This light was definitely 600 lumens, unlike almost most any light that comes from China, and claims that degree of brightness. I compared it to a great 200 lumen Surefire I have, and this is definitely much brighter. Note that there are many, many (no name)lights to choose from, mostly all China made, and take my word for it (or not) that you get what you pay for. You can not buy a high quality 600 lumen or higher handheld flashlight for $25. PERIOD. I have tried a couple--don't waste your money. I am sure the Surefire 500 lumen light is great also, but it was closer to $120, with shipping. The ony negative I have re: this light is that it has a broader beam than I would like. For walking the dog at night, this is great, but I was looking for a more focused beam. But, this is bright, has great throw, and will function well for why I bought it, namely as a tactical light to use in my home in case of intruders, to buy myself a second or two advantage.

821,R21Q4F26B0GH1G,True,Unexpectedly tough little flashlight,"Probably the best tactical mini-light I have owned. It has worked without a hiccup for several years of constant life in my pocket. Recently, it survived an accidental wash/dry cycle. The recessed lens is very well protected behind some aluminum prongs. To the point where I have dropped it lens first onto concrete with no loss of function. (Just minor scuffing on the finish.) The water seal is also amazingly good given that it survived a trip through the washing machine and drier with no loss of function or apparent damage.

One minor issue is heat buildup during sustained use in high intensity mode.

Update:
Light is awesome. The pocket clip is not. I carried it daily for months. Then I noticed that the clip would sometimes pop off (it just snaps on). Eventually it popped off during daily carry. The flashlight slid into my pocket. The clip flew off into who knows where. I didn't notice until later. So now the light is relegated to nightstand duty, and I'm shopping for a replacement.

840,R3FVQ3SLSH5AXJ,True,Good manufacturing. No low battery warning. Just poof!,"I'm going to be a little harsh. The quality of the flashlight is very good, however. The little rubber thingie in the back disappeared one day and I have no idea where or how it fell off. The real issue with me is that there is no indication of the batteries running low. It works, then it doesn't. Lousy for any tactical situations. I can't afford to have a flashlight that ""might"" work when I turn it on. If I had some kind of indication - lights getting progressively low - then I could work with it. But it doesn't do that.

General size: awesome. Standard battery sizes: awesome. General durability: Good to great. Overall: Ehhh. Good for what I need it to do, but I always keep a spare battery pack in my bag. I made a leather holder for it. Photo should show missing button piece.

9 Sep 2017: Update
So my little Streamlight finally went poof ... and a permanent basis. The switch has been acting up, and although I ignored it for a while it just got worse. I just re-read the review ""By Andrew on October 26, 2013"" and it seems that there was an issue with the switch. The light itself (LED), the housing all seem both fine and durable. However, without a switch that works, the flashlight doesn't work.

So I bought a generic LED flashlight at Lowe's and that one works fine. I now have a paperweight. Sigh.

847,R5NPBN46ABDLZ,True,Nice light. Make sure it's authentic.,"I bought this as an upgrade to my fenix ld12 which has been my primary edc light for about 5 years. I own some other lights(surefire,olight) but they're dedicated to different bags or guns. I wanted some more capability with my edc light so I bought this, mostly for the increased lumens and ability to use cr123s and AAs. Honestly it's not significantly brighter compared to my ld12 with AA lithium. I'll still say this is 5 stars due to the capability of accepting both batteries and the overall quality.

849,R250OAKWJ2SN6D,True,Small and Powerful,I have always been a flashlight lover. I am also a Streamlight fan. This light in particular is much brighter than my 47 lumen Stylus Pro. Plus it offers high/strobe/low. It throws a little further and has larger scatter. The great thing about it is it runs off of AAA batteries and yet it still lasts forever even on high. If you run Energizer Ultimate Lithium the light will last longer and be brighter over the life of the batteries (fresh energizer MAX measured 1.55v and Lithium 1.74v). For the size of this light it does a great job and will impress anyone still in the mini maglight world. The transaction and shipping was quick and easy.

Update: I fell and broke my leg during a hiking trip. It was dark by the time the rescue crew came to get me off the mountain. The quickest route out was via a boat in a small creek. The rescue crew used this little flashlight, out of all their gear, to help navigate the dark, winding, creek. I was proud to own it at that point. The battery life is decent, buy the replacement battery on Amazon to get it at the best price.

878,RRL34AOR7Y9WX,True,batteries batteries batteries.,The flashlight is great at first. I bought it and ended up having it for almost a month before actually using it. Strong light that almost hurts the eyes if you have to use it up close (try the low setting). My biggest complaint is that it is not a recharge and the batteries die really quickly. I used it for one solid night checking vents and beds (I work corrections) and it has not had the power since. After maybe a total of 45 minutes to an hour the batteries are pretty much toast and I had to buy new ones.

883,R42KCXC5RV6ZK,True,Dependable and pocketable,"I bought this to keep in my work bag, as I work outdoors in all weather conditions and all times of day and night. That plan quickly went away when I realized how useful and small it was. Now I keep it in my pocket at all times and it sure has come in handy.

The high beam is a good mixture of spot and flood, and will reach about 50 feet reliably. After that it noticeably starts to dim. For up close work it's almost too much as anything light colored almost glows in the beam. If you're looking for small items under seats or trying to see what's happening on the other side of the street it's superb.

The strobe function is very disorienting. It has a reasonably fast cycle time and would work well for signaling as well.

The low beam provides a nice general duty level of light. It's not enough to see fibers in the carpet, but enough to read a map by or identify a person without blinding them.

As far as build quality it's tough, after a month in my pocket putting up with rain, hard impacts and my fingers fiddling with it it hasn't shown any damage beyond lint build up around the power button. The belt or pocket clip does swivel around the body of the light and is removable so over time this might lead to scratches, but nothing on mine so far.

An initial fear I had was that it would accidentally turn on in my pocket, but the switch has enough resistance it takes a deliberate firm press to activate it.

The pouch is a decent nylon sheath with a Velcro closure as well as a Velcro'd strap to go around your belt. The only issue I've had with the pouch is that when I sit down it gets pushed up my belt and presses into my back, and the Velcro over the opening is a bit small. If it catches on anything it sometimes opens up. I considered this an extra so I won't let it affect my overall review.

Pros:
Pocketable
Dependable
Well built
Bright

Cons:
Pouch belt loop is too big for normal belts
Swiveling belt clip
Strobe function being between high and low",the united states,"November 23, 2013",Steven,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:35:01.243930,2020-10-27 22:35:01.379569,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The flaw: The sequence of click-operation is high, strobe, low. To activate low-intensity mode, which is what I use most often, I have to click through high and strobe first.

931,R1CB9XKLQQXDT4,True,Fantastic Self-Defense Light,"If you are looking for a light which has all the features of a self-defense light without wanting to spend the highers prices for professional-level tactical lights ($80-$150), this is the light for you.

The features which make this a great light for self defense:
- Small, but not too small, size. You can carry this on your belt easily without it getting in the way.
- Crazy bright, and I mean stunningly bright, light. This will stop someone in their tracks.
- The button is on the back end, so you can hold it in your fist.
- The button will turn on the light with gentle pressure instead of a full click and release (as most lights do).
- Three modes: normal, strobe, and dim are perfect (including the strobe rate).
- Crown bezel (probably the most minor advantage of the bunch).
- And a surprise feature I didn't expect: the belt clip is a snap release allowing for very fast deployment.

Potential disadvantages:
- Not rechargeable - it uses standard batteries.
- The batteries are not typical AA, or AAA, but still appear to be easy to find at local stores.

I would heartily recommend this light in a heartbeat! It is the only light I have found so far which fits the the self defense application well, and doesn't cost a hefty amount.

The other is that the clip has come off the flashlight twice in about 6 months. It's not a big deal to pop it back on, as long as you hear it fall. Both times were when I was getting into car.

968,R1ICKAVATS7RS9,True,Packs a punch!,"Lightweight, bright, and durable. I have loved this flashlight. I keep it in the center console of my car at all times. It has come in handy countless times. The only downside to purchasing a flashlight of this caliber is that the batteries are more expensive than AAs or AAAs unless you know where to look.

It's a tactical flashlight and it handles like one. Size wise it is on the smaller end of the tactical spectrum but it is still incredibly bright. Even in the daylight if you were to shine it in someone's eyes, it would phase them. Plus, if all else fails you could just hit them in the face with it--it wouldn't break the flashlight at all--only their nose.

980,RPH78PC2MQ33F,True,"Fantastic Flashlight. Perfect for technicians who need a good, solid, reliable flashlight.","In my opinion, this is an excellent flashlight. The size is not to big but it has a substantial feel, unlike smaller diameter flashlights which feel small in the hand. The larger diameter of the body feels just right and when holding it. I am a maintenance technician at a manufacturing facility and I use this light daily on the job. It's absolutely perfect. The beam spill/throw has a tactical focus with a good bright center circle that doesn't have a sharp edge and gradually spreads out the further away it is shone. It spills some light to the sides to see where you're going. I also own the 2L version, which is slightly brighter, but not enough to justify the extra length. I've owned it for over a year now and have never experienced any issues with the tail cap switch. If you buy Duracell batteries off of Amazon in multiples of 10 or so, you can get them for about $2 each. I go through a battery every 2 months, give or take a couple of weeks. My only gripe would be the holster; it works fine but over time and repeated use the hook & loop (Velcro) on the flap closure deteriorates and won't stay closed.

UPDATE:
I have found rechargeable batteries for this here on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FWN297W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

They work great! For only $10 I now have two batteries that I can swap out as needed. No more need to buy disposable, one-time use batteries anymore! This makes this flashlight absolutely perfect! I used to use it sparingly because the CR123 batteries have a cost, but that problem is no longer an issue.

I modified the holster, as the hook & loop closure was worn out and had become completely unusable. I carefully shaved off the remaining hooks and loops with a disposable razor, then using an exacto knife I carefully cut open the stitching of the hook and loop patches enough to insert a small neodymium magnet into the closure flap and a small piece of flat metal into the holster. I then sewed them back shut with a sewing needle and black thread to secure them from falling out. The result is fantastic! The magnet allows the flap to quickly cling to the holster without worrying about alignment. It also makes opening and closing virtually silent. It is far easier to access the light now and to return it to the holster. I will soon be replacing the holster as it is becoming torn near the bottom where the tactical flares of the lens have been chafing the holster. It has held up remarkably well though, considering the use and abuse I've put it through. I will be shaving off the hooks and loops from the new holster and swapping in my magnet and metal plate over to the new holster as soon as it arrives.",the united states,"July 13, 2014",Adam,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:35:57.492570,2020-10-27 22:35:57.639210,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

This flashlight is very bright and can Throw it's beam quite far.
It can be set to a lower setting if needed to reserve battery life.
Fits nicely in my hand

Cons:
The way to change between High, Strobe, and Low can be a pain.
Strobe is the middle setting, so you have to go to it to get to the low setting.
Sometimes when on the low setting the light will switch to High on its own.
The batteries are not as easy to find, but not impossible.

985,R3FCLDROJVH4BO,True,Surefire quality at a Streamlight price,"This light was purchased to carry on duty. I have a few older Surefire lights to compare it to. While I looked at the newer Surefire lights (and they are fine quality flashlights) there are two reasons I went with the Streamlight. One was price, while the quality of the Surefire is good they have kind of priced themselves out of the police market except for SWAT teams who have a lot of their gear issued by the agency, hence price is not a concern. The second reason I went with the Streamlight was the tail cap which has a rim on it to prevent it from coming on accidentally when you sit down in a car seat (I wear the light behind my left hip and on the Surefire if you don't back the tail cap out every time you holster it the light comes on draining those expensive CR123 batteries). Another positive was the 260 lumen output. If you take one of the older LED's (60-80 lumen range) and try to search a large open area the light dissipates too much to allow an effective search. For building searches I would have to break out the old halogen light (a Straemlight Super Stinger which is 15 years old, carried on duty all of those years and still works but is on its fourth battery by now). With a 260 lumen output I don't have to switch lights although I still go to the rechargeable light depending on how big the building is. The only downside to this light is nobody that I have found makes a good duty holster for it, but it's small enough I usually just put it in my shirt cargo pocket. Thus far I have dropped it once from about three feet on to asphalt and it still runs just fine. The jury is still out in terms of durability but as my other Streamlight is again 15 years old and still running, I suspect it will do just fine. On a side note it is supposedly programmable but I have not messed with that feature. If things were to go bad I want the light to come with all the power it has quickly, not be fumbling with what mode it's instead of getting a gun on the threat. It comes from the factory set to be either on at full power or off.

992,R13IKIMMCKIA56,True,Great light,I bought this flashlight for EDC purposes. The slimline profile and short length make the flashlight ideal for all day pocket carry. The light is super bright for its size and is perfect as a backup to my Streamlight Propolymer Haz Lo I am required to carry at work. The only downside I have found for this product is the pocket clip itself. I would prefer more of a positive engagement of the clip to the flashlight body. When wearing jeans you can't just push the clip all the way onto your pocket without the clip spring boarding itself off and bouncing on the floor. I have tried stretching the clip out slightly to make it easier to slide on and off of my pocket but nothing seems to help. I find myself having the hold the clip out away from the flashlight body and sliding it onto my pocket so it does not disengage from the flashlight. The tactical push button switch took me a day or two to get used to but I love way it works now. As others have said the low setting needs to be the second click instead of third. All this being said I really don't think I could have found a better flashlight for the money.,the united states,"January 8, 2013",Casey Cartwright,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:36:01.365216,2020-10-27 22:36:01.513819,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1010,RFZ0XOGELXKDU,True,Bright Bright Bright!,"I've had this light for around 3 weeks now and I use it for work. I would like to start by saying that this is the second streamlight I have owned and it is bright for 180 lumens rating, streamlight is up there with surefire and fenix minus the expensive price tag. I leave for work when it's still very dark way before everyone wakes up and so I use this to walk to my car looking for anything unusual and where I currently live at there are bears, coyotes, and other creature of the night that I don't want having any interests in me as well as muggers. I also use this for backup light while I use my coast flashlight for vehicle inspections.

The momentary on is a great feature, changing modes on the light requires using momentary on which doesn't really bother me since all I really need the light for is to see what's in my surrounding or to blind a suspicious person during my job along with the use of OC should the person being inspected decide to start trouble. This light is small and compact yet gets the job done and won't get in your way of driving or work and additionally it is very lightweight.

It uses 1 cr123a battery to me this isn't a problem, so far my light is still bright and I haven't changed the battery yet therefore the runtime is excellent. It comes with a holster and already installed on it is a clip.

Overall, a good torch will light up the night very bright and uses 1 cr123a instead of 2 or more so saves me on money for batteries, having a holster is a plus but if you need to put it on a duty belt unfortunately it won't do.

1011,RPSH5BQ6RVO7V,True,I'll always pick a Streamlight.,"I recently swapped my Streamlight Protac 2AAA, which I've carried every day for about 2 years, for this gem. This isn't a lot thicker, but it's a few inches shorter, and it packs a punch for light output. My wife has had her Protac 2L for a year or so and I had to get one of my own.

I am a fan of the 10-tap programming, which isn't difficult to figure out, but I prefer the factory setting (High-Strobe-Low), so I didn't use this feature except to say I had tried it. The beam pattern is very even with no dark spots, and it has a nicely focused hotspot right in the center. When comparing to my Jetbeam PC20, which advertises considerably higher lumen output, I noticed the Protac 2L actually was brighter in the center area, which is where I'm typically focused when using my lights, anyway. The Jetbeam DID have more flood than this light, though, so that may be where the other lumens factor in. On this note, I have always felt Streamlight to be conservative in their lumen rating; when comparing to lights from other manufacturers, I have found time and again the Streamlights are actually brighter than lights with a higher lumen rating. I may not know how to compare a lumen to a candela, but I do know a light rated at 260 lumens should have less light than a light rated at 400 lumens. If you are new to LED flashlights or if you havent bought one in a few years, the amount of light pouring out if this compact light will wow you.

The body of this light is nicely finished and a good bit smaller than my jetbeam light that also uses two cr123 batteries. The clip is sturdy and isn't going to come off without a stout tug. The switch is recessed and has a good, affirmative click. It's also easy to do a momentary press without actually clicking the light into the steady-on position. I'm not too hot with morse code, but this style switch would make something like this easier.

When considering the build quality, the price, battery life, and light output, I felt this light was the best in it's class.
While I won't deny a Surefire is a superb flashlight, and I have owned them, their lights just don't deliver enough extra benefit to be worth the premium in price. A Streamlight lasts forever, and I have found time and again they will stand by their warranty if you do manage to break something.

1018,RHQDZQ4J9W41,True,ProTac 2L-X. Almost perfect light. Will almost tail stand but not quite. Needs a small spring for the positive battery contact.,"This review is for the ProTac 2L-X

I really like most things about this light. I'd been buying cheap lights that advertise as 1000 lumen or more that have much brighter xml-t6 bulbs. Comparing them to this light, they're not any brighter. I believe this light to be more efficient or maybe the T6's being used by the cheapest flashlights are under-performing to where they're about 500 as this light actually is. The Ten-tap is awesome and works flawlessly. I do have a couple
gripes that would be easy for Streamlight to correct that I'll list at the bottom for easy reading.

Pros: Ten-tap works perfect
500 lumen is probably accurate and equal to the suposed 1000 lumen of the cheap lights
size and weight is great for edc

cons: light will not tail stand. The button is inset like it was meant to but the rubber sticks out about 1/8 inch too far.
the contact for the positive end of the battery is flat so some 18650 batteries will not work without adding some solder to them
The clip interferes with removing the switch for battery charging/swapping. I don't use it but if you do, it's annoying

These 3 cons could easily be corrected with inexpensive adjustments.",the united states,"March 25, 2018",Jeff,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:36:10.436000,2020-10-27 22:36:10.574598,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

Tried it during the day in a large room (20' wide by 50' long) with the windows open and you can easily see the beam against the far wall. Tried it again at night and it lights up the room.

1044,R1DAXFJKNX9BKC,True,Good tactical light,"I just purchased two of these lights. One for the wife and I for our EDC. I opened the package up and was pleasantly surprised. It comes with a case and two batteries as promised. I was surprised at the size of the light . It fit in my hands with no problem. I compared it to my Techlight Lumen Master 200. Size wise they both are handy but the Streamlight is a little bit longer by an inch and a little heavier. They both feature a cap activation button with three modes. My Techlight is easier to manipulate between the different modes compared to the Streamlight. I have yet to get it to strobe or low mode. I'm still working on the instructions for operating the different modes. They are programmable, which I've never heard of before. This means you can customize it s little. The Streamlight has a pocket pen/pocket clip that seems to be sturdy enough. It fits in my 5.11 pants pocket with no problem. The case has velcro to fit on your belt and keeps it secure. I have not experienced any problems so far with it coming out, as stated in another review. We'll see what happens. My Techlight only has a lanyard. I couldn't wait till it got dark. I took the dog for a walk about 1am and man was I ever happy. I walk through the woods and this time I had more than enough light. I compared my lights and found the Streamlight to be much brighter. Wow! With 600 lumens burning it got warm to the touch. It's to be expected burning three times as much light. I really like it and will be using it everyday.

1052,R29E2P6VAH4IZB,True,Attn. Cops: Read this for real talk.,"Four stars. Here's why:

1. I work patrol at nights....I haven't found anyone with a brighter flashlight than this one. If we are looking for something/someone in the dark, everyone wants me beside them because this thing turns night to day. So incredibly bright when it's on the 1100 lumen setting. Words cannot describe how awesome this flashlight is when you need to cut deep into the darkness.

2. I really wanted to give it three stars, but it's better than that. I reason I almost provided a three star rating is because IT TAKES THE MOST EXPENSIVE BATTERIES EVER MADE. CR-123's do NOT come cheap, Streamlight! Come on now.... This thing needs two upgrades as far battery issues go: Make it a bit longer so it can have both a rechargeable battery in it AND some CR-123's. In times of crisis, 2 hours of the bright setting is not enough! We rely on these things when times get hard in the field....whether it be a homicide invest., car accident, kidnapping invest., searching for a bank robber in the woods..... It is not acceptable for the battery to die after 2 hours. Enough said about that.

3. Design and Functionality: Ughhhh..... It has a button on the rear of the light. It NEEDS a button there as well as a shaft button near the head of the flashlight. It just does. Other than that, it is built tough.

This is the my biggest grievance other than the battery deal: IT GOES FROM A BLINDING 1100 LUMEN HIGH SETTING TO 60 LUMENS ON THE LOW SETTING!!! 60 lumens?!?!? How did it never cross anyones mind that those are two extremely different settings and there needs to be a happy medium?!?! You've got 2 hours at 1100 lumens, then you've got 36 hours at 60 lumens....So why on God's green earth can I not have 250 lumens for 10-12 hours???? Every now and then, 60 lumens works, but it is often not enough...at which time I'll switch to the 1100 lumens high setting, but sometimes that is just too much brightness.

1066,R1IR0IBBYBQO93,True,Good flashlight for the money,"I've carried this flashlight every day for the last four months or so (recently broke it in a fit of rage, more on that later). I found it to be a worthwhile investment, but instead of buying another one I'm stepping up to a brighter light (at twice the price).

Fit & Finish - The finish on the body of the light is pretty durable. It wore through the coating on the ends of the light and on the high spots (particularly around the anti-roll part on the body near the LED). Other than that, the finish on the body has held up great to being washed, soaked in motor oil, soaked in brake fluid, and being dropped from 1-2m. It was dropped & exposed to the above chemicals daily and the finish was never damaged and the light never ceased to function. The only thing that killed the light was me throwing it at a concrete floor when I was mad (this scratched up the body some, knocked the ""lens"" off the LED, and messed up the circuit).

The end-caps did occasionally loosen themselves, rendering the light useless, but fixing that was as simple as tightening them back up. The batteries do occasionally jiggle in the body (I used SureFire batteries, your results may vary). The threads on the light are not the highest quality, but they certainly get the job done. The o-rings could be thicker as well, but the light never leaked.

The clip has a good tension to it. Not to tight and not to loose, works great in a pants pocket, but doesn't hold onto thin fabrics as well. It wore through the coating along the edges as one would expect, but it does not stand up to chemicals (particularly brake fluid) as well as the body. The finish didn't just come off, but it did fade/dull quite a bit.

Brightness - It could certainly use a middle setting. I found the low setting to be useless 95% of the time and the high setting to be overpowering on occasion. I can't comment on how it compares to other 180-lumen lights, but there are plenty of comparison videos around the net. The high setting is certainly enough to blind someone at night, even in the city, and the strobe will give them quite the headache.

Battery consumption - At full power, you'll kill the batteries in just over an hour.

Holster - I don't think it fit the light well nor did it sit well on a belt. I simply threw it away; the light has a pocket clip after all.

Switch - Took a little getting used to at first, but once you get the hands of it, it is really easy and quick to work. I never had any problems with it malfunctioning. I like the switch.

Misc - If it's on a flat surface that doesn't move/vibrate, I can get the light to tailstand. It will be tilted slightly to one side, but it stands. Lights a room up well tailstanding. Standing it on it's face (light shining down), not much light is emitted, even on high.",the united states,"December 5, 2012",RotRex,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:36:38.983661,2020-10-27 22:36:39.118298,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1105,RNK2BZ04QAPLU,True,I love the products and have had ZERO problems,"Including buying a couple for gifts, I have pruchased 12 Streamlight flashlights over the last few years. I love the products and have had ZERO problems. The Protac 1L I'm reviewing here, is a very convenient size, though my favorite medium-Lumens model is the Protac 2L. Streamlight flashlights do hold up well to dropping; (ask me how I know this). I honestly don't know if they will last as long as Surefire flashlights, which truly are quality products; but Streamlight hits the perfect Price / Performance threshold for me. The ones that are made of aircraft aluminum, (Protac series and others), are great tools, (yes tools), for convenience and safety. The Protac 2L and higher Lumen flashlights REALLY WILL blind a bad guy for at least a few seconds, during which you can get out of the area.

1106,R1H2J62K2X17Z0,True,Great... But too BIG for EDC,"Nicely made, robust construction, very bright. Easy to charge with computer or iPad/iPhone charger. The bigger iPad charger works great. Can also be charged in the newer cars that come with USB ports, or with a USB cable in a cigarette lighter adapter. I especially like the rechargeable feature.
Unless you are going to carry this on a duty belt, I feel it is too bulky in length, diameter & overall weight for EDC in a pocket. I personally prefer my Streamlight Pro-Tac 1L with its single CR123 battery. I like the fact that the HL can use the alternate batteries such as 2-CR123A's or lithium rechargeable 18650.
Comes programmed for ""bright-strobe-low"" but easily changed to ""high only"" or ""low-medium-high"" using the 10 tap programmable switch. On a side note you may consider the Pro-Tac 2L as an alternative for EDC.

I recently purchased a Stinger DS HPL (720 lumen) light as my primary light and bought this ProTac HL3 as a back up light. I am fully impressed with the brightness of the ProTac HL3 (1100 lumen).
My only critiques so far is the reported run time of 1.25 hours on full brightness (therefore, it will be my back up light for now since it uses CR123 batteries), and lack of an intermediate setting (similar to the Stinger DS HPL). With that said, you can't beat the lumens.

1164,R39KNSKQMXBBQD,True,So Far So Good,"I like aaa flashlights. Don't know why but I do.

This one replaced a Streamlight Stylus Pro that I keep in a tool kit that I take with me whenever I travel... I liked that light, but ended up donating it to someone somewhere on the eastern seaboard last month, so I got the ProTac as a replacement- mainly because I like the idea of having a high and low setting. Sometimes you want a blindingly bright beam, sometimes you want something a little less pupil crushing... not to mention the option to conserve battery life (I really like the idea of 30 hours on one set of batteries on Low).

Cycling through the modes is easy once you get the hang of it- as another reviewer mentioned, do so using ""half-presses"" of the tail switch, not ""full clicks""- only ""click"" the button when you reach the desired mode.

Speaking of modes- I REALLY have no use for the strobe. I don't think 99.99% of the population does either. Even if I were using this light in conjunction with my pistol in a ""tactical"" situation, I'm 99.99999% sure I still wouldn't used the damned strobe. I'd just turn the flashlight on. Get rid of that useless, silly function- K.I.S.S.- keep it to ""high"" and ""low"" settings and I'll give it 5 stars.

UPDATE: I just thought of a use for the strobe function- impromptu living room dance parties during blackouts! Just kidding.

1170,R2XG6NDIJX5SAO,True,Spaceballs the flashlight,"4.5 stars rounds up to 5. The size is perfect for pocket clip carry. Works well with my K2 rechargeable CR123 (old Surefire brand) and Goal Zero AA and it does work with AAA, even though instructions do not recommend any of these. This is a triple fuel light. Beam is slightly yellow compared to my ProTac AA but that light is very blue and this resembles more a Surefire beam and the colors are true. Just bent the pocket clip, many reviews fault the design.

That's when I found the Streamlight PT 2L on Amazon.com!! I have had it for just over 6 months now, carry it every day, and have had ZERO problems. I've even dropped it on concrete multiple times, and have used it as a door stop a few times too. This little thing is just amazing, outrageously bright on the high setting! The brightness to size ratio is incredible, I can shine my enormous 3D Maglite on the wall, and this PT 2L almost completely drowns out the light from the Maglite. The CR123A batteries are relatively cheap and long-lasting. Plus, they won't corrode inside the flashlight, even if you leave it sit for prolonged periods of time.

You don't realize how many times you could use a flashlight, until its right there in your pocket. At first, my friends tried to give me crap for carrying the flashlight around with me, but now they are constantly asking me to, ""Turn on the sun!"" =D

At the shipyards if the lights go out you're stuck in pitch black spaces. With 750Lumens I don't only light the way for me but for everybody around me. The lights went out at my daughter's birthday party and this light was bright enough to light up the area to break the piñata. I always take it on the road because it always comes in handy.

1210,R3R69HM5B2NLJF,True,Another Nice Light from Streamlight,"Good product for the price. Pocket clip is strong and functional. Nice that it can be clipped to a hat without having to take the clip off and flip it backwards. Nicely redesigned. Light is bright with a neutral tint. Low is useful at 40 lumens, high is well suited for a variety of tasks both indoors and outdoors. NOTE: I am referring to 350 lumens high setting with a CR123 battery. The dual fuel capability is versatile and more and more lights will probably have this feature moving forward. Comparing the beam to a Streamlight ProTac 1L (180 lumen CR123 light) the hot spot in the 1L-1AA is larger and hotter. It fills more space with more light giving better peripheral vision. The low setting of 40 lumens is (IMO) more effective for indoor tasks that require more than 12 lumens but not 180 (high ProTac 1L) or 350 (high for 1L-1AA with CR123). This gives enough light to easily see indoors without going through your battery too fast. The light feels nice in the hand. It's slightly longer than the ProTac 1L and the tail cap has knurling which adds a more secure feeling when you hold it.

Now I want to talk batteries. There is a rechargeable that is safe to use with these lights. You can also use these batteries with Surefire lights. Amazon sells them. Here is a link.

K2 Energy LFP123A Rechargeable Li Ion 3.2V Battery Replaces CR123A - Single

These batteries are fully charged at 3.65v. They can be used safely to 2.8v. They have a nominal capacity of 600mAh. The chemistry is Lithium Iron Phosphate or LiFePO4. They maintain a steady 3.2v. This means your light will maintain a high level of light output. If using the light for a long time the microprocessor may stage down the light output because of thermal regulation, but not due to the voltage dropping. 3.2v is maintained for more than 90% of the charge cycle. Once the light enters ""low mode"" turn the light off, and charge them up. Simple. Over discharging can damage them. The runtimes are decent in the Streamlights I own. Protac 1L, ProTac 1L-1AA. I also use this in a Gen 2 Surefire Fury, 600 lumens. (no runtime test yet conducted on the Surefire with these batteries) It saves money in the long run and the fact that you can charge them up at any time means you will not have to guess how much power is in your light. When you turn on your light, you're getting max output, sustained. One battery charges in 80 min and 2 batteries charge in 160 minutes. Those charge times reflect 2.8v up to full at 3.65v. I use the charger that came with the batteries made by the same company. There is a picture in the link above. You can charge these batteries ONLY in a charger that specifically states it can charge LiFePO4 batteries! Here is another example:

XTAR VP2 Independent 2-Channel Battery Charger w/ Dual Voltage Display, USB Power Bank for 18560 and similar Lithium Ion and LiFePO4 Cells (Simple Kit - no Car Charger included, A/C adapter only)

Do not charge above C/1. The capacity is 600mAh so charge at NO MORE THAN 600mA or .6A. Really 300mA (.3A) to 500mA (.5A) is safe and still fast. Keep a spare set with you and be ready. Most chargers come with or offer a car adapter to charge on the go.

*update*
It's now Fri, 25 Aug 2017. After having this light for several months, I change my rating from 5 stars down to 4 stars. Here's why: The body of the light is too smooth. The knurling on the tail cap is not aggressive enough to provide a secure grip. The body having no knurling on it baffles my mind. The light output, beam quality, function, etc all remain excellent. The pocket clips dual use feature is still awesome. It simply needs to feel more secure in hand.

1223,R3SF4BEDNO9B6T,True,Night is Day,"Just a quick tip... This light ROCKS!!! It's small, compact and light weight. This light gives off a bright beam of light into the darkness. Good center beam. Good amount of side spill to light up the surrounding area. It has a strobe and dim led setting for various needs.

I turned off the back lights and went into a dark yard. My yard is about 180 feet long from wall to wall. I stood at one end and lit up the far side. If there were an animal of any sort or a bad guy lurking in the corner, it would have been spotted with ease and clarity!

A fellow co-worker who is extremely into tactical gear had purchased the smaller Pt1 version {(1)CR123 } battery and showed me how bright it was in the office.
After seeing it, I wanted one also. I just went with the (2) CR123 battery version. It does have a bit extra lumens for the bang factor.

Make sure you choose the light with the type of batteries you carry / use. I almost bought the AA version instead of the CR123, but observed the mistake before I bought it.

Great for a bug out bag or vehicle center console for those ""uh-oh"" moments when you need a light!!

This is not a ""tactical"" pistol grip style light. It's merely a light!!!! You can use it that way in a pinch, but not full time. It's pretty small for that.

The lights are not too expensive. Around 38 bucks or so, plus shipping costs.

It comes with a metal clip attached and a small carry case. The clip seems pretty sturdy with ""heft"" and will do the job! The carry case is plain and simple. It's a case guys. Dont make a purchase decision over a case.

Buy one and try it out!!! I dont think you will be sorry and have anything to complain about!!!

Here is the sarcasim...If you do complain, I'll bet you would complain about everything and anything.

Hope this helps you decide on buying this light!!

1242,R339HOWQT817WI,True,I Like It,"The Streamlight reputation lives on nicely with the ProTac series. This one is the 2L (meaning it needs two lithium batteries).

At a compact 4-5/8"" long and just under 1"" thick, it's nicely-made for a pocket. The finish is anodized aluminum in black, and I love the matte finish Streamlight puts on their lights. A pocket clip is included, which can be removed. It keeps the light at the top of your pocket, ready to go. I have no complaints about the tension or the design, but it leaves quite a bit (a little over an inch) of the light sticking out of your pocket. Bump into the corner of a room, or a car, and the light pivots around the clip and comes out of your pocket. A basic nylon holster is provided, and it closes with a Velcro closure. The holster will fit a belt up to 2"" wide, and to be honest, mine hasn't held up too well in daily use. It's basic and inexpensive. Two Streamlight-branded CR123A lithium batteries are provided. If you're an 18650 user, you can't use them in this light without boring it out.

The reflector appears to be plastic, and it's smooth. The lens is also plastic. I haven't seen any artifacts or rings in my ProTac at all, and the smooth reflector adds to the distance the beam can go. The beam is a nice combination of flood and throw, being just a little bit more throw-oriented. The tailcap has three modes: high, low, and strobe. The specs list high as 180 lumens. In my testing, it's about 140 lumens. Low appears to be accurate at 10 lumens. Strobe is 140 (listed at 180) lumens at 9 Hz. I didn't test runtime, but knowing Streamlight's specs, it should be about 80% of what's listed. The tailcap has a forward clicky switch, and it comes in in high, then low if you press it within half a second, then strobe if you press it within half a second of that.

The reason the ProTac doesn't get a higher rating with me is because it's a bit overpriced. Honestly, you can go to many flashlight websites and find a light with multiple modes, higher (and lower) output, with pretty much the same quality, at lower prices. Many Romisen lights have the same features as the ProTac, at 80% of the build quality, with half the price.",the united states,"May 18, 2013",JNieporte,4.0,0,2020-10-27 22:38:21.097612,2020-10-27 22:38:21.242225,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1267,R9HHB3QG0O39J,True,Light is amazing and high quality known for Streamlight,"Light is amazing and high quality known for Streamlight. Don't waste your money on cheap flashlights that say they are high lumens because they can vary significantly and are usually falsely advertised. This states 1100 lumens which it may be as it is much brighter than my 420 lumen light high quality light I have which recently malfunctioned. That light was almost twice as much and even though its covered under warranty the value is diminished when compared to a light for half the price with equal quality and higher performance.

I've bought lights that state they are over 300 lumens for $50 and under but they are no brighter than a 90 lumen light I have.

I use this light is for police work and has a reasonable size to be mounted on a duty belt and fits your hand perfectly. If your not using a light for police work, cheaper lights will work just fine for you even if lumens are falsely advertised. But when you rely on illuminating as much as possibleto protect yourself or locate someone this light will get the job done.

One issue I have is the tail cap switch being recessed as much as it is but still functions as needed.

I haven't used it outside at night as of yet but have used it in a dark room and it illuminates everything with an acceptable focal beam. Based on this I would assume it will do just fine outside. I have used many flashlights over the years from Surefire, other Streamlight products and other cheap lights. This is the real deal for not a lot of money (under $90.00) where I have spent hundreds on others and this is comparable to any of those.

It does use the CR123A batteries and I wish it used AAA or AA batteries based on cost but I prefer standard batteries over rechargeable anyways because when it dies I can just replace the batteries instead of waiting for a recharge or spending $$$'s for a spare rechargeable battery that will eventually lose its life over time anyways.",the united states,"August 15, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:38:29.999814,2020-10-27 22:38:30.143434,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1297,R4CB5GEDDXPRJ,True,Best bang for the buck.,"At 600 lumens, this light puts out a enough light to make a perp see spots when shined in their beady eyes. (don't try this at home!).

Other lights may have 660 or even 1000 lumens, but are either not in the same cost/benefit wheelhouse, or are overkill IMO. What's next, a light saber? I had one of those when I was a kid and it didn't scare anybody.

I just love, love, love how these manufactures weaponize these 'tec lights'. Come on now, they're not selling these high power lights to find your car keys. The lens has relatively sharp, 'sawtooth' corners surrounding the lens bezel. Only there to inflict more...um... discomfort from the multiple edging. There I said it. If you buy the corporate line that those corners are there to 'prevent roll away', then I have another Democrat for President for you.

There are limitations to this light however.

The strobe feature --now all you liberals cover your eyes---which is DESIGNED to disorient the aforementioned perp, is activated by tapping the power button. The only problem is that it takes some fine motor control in your finger to tap it just so. NOT going to happen in times of stress.

The 3V lithium batteries (yes, this light comes with batteries which arrived at a healthy 3.59 volts), do not like sustained cold temperatures. Or more correctly, they can tolerate the cold but need to be warmed up to generate reliable voltage. This means this is not the light to leave in your glove box during cold weather. You will have to work around that unless you just want a mini baton.

And speaking of batonage, the eye for a lanyard is part of the clip-on belt clip. This light would make for a nice, modern Flail if the lanyard loop was cast into the aluminum body. Because of the tension clip, I'm sure your light will reach escape velocity if you try too hard to go Medieval on someone. It's best used as an eyesocket probe at that point as the movie ""Kill Bill"" flashes through your mind--you know what I mean Hillary

So good luck and I hope you only use it to find your keys.

I had seen flashlights with more lumen but for its price and portability I would definitely stick with this product. After putting it to the test a few nights ago, I certainly did not feel I was lacking in output, in fact the friends that were with me already want to place their order and I have also recommended it to other geocachers that enjoy night travel, The only small warning I have for this flashlight is that it does warm up significantly after prolonged use.

I finally decided that having ordinary batteries (AA or AAA) was important to me. That eliminated a lot of the really high lumen lights but it's a trade I was comfortable with. Streamlight 88039 takes AAA and the 88033 takes AA. Would 88039 be too small or 88033 too big? I finally decided to order them both. 88039 is a great size to carry clipped into your front pants pocket. It's not heavy or bulky. It's an amazingly bright light, a strobe mode, and a low light level. I really like it. The 88033 is the bigger brother. Everything is the same it's just bigger and brighter. I drop it into my pocket every morning and every night when I head outside, in the dark, to check on things in the barn. The high setting on 88033 seems to put out more light than my car headlights.

I have to hold the light's body with on hand and push the click-switch with a finger or thumb of the other hand.

It fits really well, because of this thin size. However, it isn't too thin to be difficult to grip. It is probably about the diameter of a Sharpie but a little longer.

The pushbutton activation works well. The light is VERY bright; 80 lumens will do the trick for sure. It feels pretty durable, but I haven't put it through any hard work yet. I also liked that it was power by AAA batteries, because I have a Streamlight MicroStream that lives in my pocket, which also runs on AAA's.

1409,R2V9GWZBZG0U2C,True,A great deal and great light,"I bought this in March of 2012 and I love this light. It's bright and disorienting and light wait. This is part of my EDC and has come into use many times. People make fun of me for carrying a light but when they see how strong it is they buy one. The beam is strong goes pretty far but I would not recommend this light as a primary flash light. It's good indoors and for the city streets. The only down side is it does scratch easily and the anti roll device doesn't work that well. Other wise it's great to have in your pockets and doesn't weigh that much. The strobe is very disorienting and the removable clip is great. You can reverse the clip and wear the light on a hat for hands free objectives. Over all I would recommend this flash light to any one who wants a utility, tactical, or just a simple bright light to have with them at all times. Oh and I submerged my light in the water while turned on and it did just find. And it comes with 2 batteries and a nylon case which is a plus. Amazing long lasting durable light.

1466,R9INVB7MAUMQM,True,Little torch,"Streamlight is known for making excellent products. Having said that this light has a few things that cause it to fail in getting a higher rating. Don't get me wrong this is a nice little light. But there are some flaws. Flaw number1: The end tail cap switch will fail to turn on the light occasionally when depressed all the way. There have been a few times that it has taken a number of clicks to get it to come and stay on. Flaw number 2: If you run it on it's highest setting too long it will get extremely hot! As a result, it will eat batteries if left on it's highest setting faster than what it is rated for. Momentary use of the brightest setting works extremely well. No issues there. So, what is good you ask? 1/ Construction. Build quality is very good. 2/ Size. I like it because it's light weight and fits in pockets very easily. 3/ It uses only 1 CR123 battery. 4/ Brightness level is more than adequate. It is rated for 110 lumen at it's highest setting. I'm thinking that this might be a little generous. It does throw a good light pattern up to about 80 feet or so. So, best uses, IMHO, great back up light or back pack light or nightstand. I've been using it as my main carry light for personal use as I use a Surefire G2 for work. I am thinking of replacing this though and getting something that runs on AA batts rather than 123's.

1480,R21EJ282CM4G0D,True,Great small backup duty light and everyday carry pocket light!,"I'm a police officer and I've worked nights for over 10 years, so I learned long ago to carry as many flashlights as I reasonably can when I'm working. It's a dreadful feeling when your flashlight starts to go dead when you're tracking suspects through the woods, on a lengthy car stop on the side of a busy highway, or working some other incident where there's no ability to stop and go recharge your light. My primary light carried on my duty belt is a Streamlight PolyStinger DS LED, my secondary is a Streamlight Strion LED, and for my third light I used to carry some cheap no-name pocket LED light that was essentially worthless but that I figured was better than nothing.

I decided it was finally time to find a good quality backup pocket light for my third slot. As you can tell from my other lights I like Streamlight, but I'm also willing to carry whatever I feel is best for the job. My bias towards Streamlight is that they makes good quality durable lights, many which are rechargeable which is a huge plus when you're paying for all your equipment costs on a cop's salary. They back their products (they've repaired/replaced lights at no cost when I've managed to kill them in the past), and they are more affordable than some of the other manufacturers out there. I know SureFire is the big thing in the tactical arena, and I have used and do like some of their lights (I've currently got their weapon-light on my primary duty weapon), and others like Fenix have cult followings as well. But Streamlight puts out quality, durable, feature-packed lights that are just as good, and they do so at great prices. That being said, I did research several other ultra-small pocket lights (this size was about as big as I wanted to go) and I ended up choosing this Streamlight ProTac 1L.

I've been carrying the ProTac 1L for about 6 months now and it's been a great little light. The very small size, coupled with the more than adequate light output, are the two biggest reasons I love it. There are other similarly-priced small lights out there with a higher stated output, but very few that're as incredibly small as this one. Many require two CR123 batteries (or AAAs in others), while this one just needs the one CR123. It's not rechargeable which is what I love about my PolyStinger LED and Strion LED, but then again I doubt you'll find any lights this size that are rechargeable. At least using a CR123 the batteries have a long 10-year shelf life, so if I bought one of these and left it in my truck or wife's car as a spare emergency light I wouldn't have to worry about the battery running dead quickly. Now with only one CR123 versus some other pocket lights having two, that does mean this one isn't going to have quite the battery life as the others, but to me the trade-off is worth it because I'd rather carry a very small light that I may need to change the battery out a little more often instead of a larger more cumbersome one that lasts longer but that I might decide to leave at home at times because it's bigger/heavier. When I'm already wearing/carrying 25 lbs of gear at work, and I need a light to fit in my pocket, I want to keep it as small and lightweight as possible. This one fits the bill perfectly. It's about as long as my index finger and even with the CR123 battery it weighs hardly anything. According to my scale the actual weight with the battery (I don't use the pocket clip) is only 1.81 oz, which is hardly noticeable at all.

The physical design of the light is perfect. It's rugged and waterproof, which are two must-have features for me to carry it on duty. I have dropped it and banged it around plenty already and it's never skipped a beat. Even if it does end up failing it's got Streamlight's lifetime warranty which I've tested before and have faith in, plus it's only a $40 light. As far as design, a lot of the cheap small lights have the annoying cheap twist-on twist-off cap switches or a tailcap that's got a little rubber end to mimic a switch but is just spring-loaded to turn it on and off. This light has a bonafide tailcap switch, and it seems to be of the same quality and tactile feel as my Strion and Stingers. It works flawlessly for quick bursts of light or for clicking it on to turn the light on fully. The positioning of the tailcap switch allows me to easily use it as a light in my support hand while my weapon's in my strong hand without having to first rotate it in my hand to find the switch like you have to do with ones with a side-mounted switch. The contours of the body of the flashlight, instead of it being completely smooth, gives you a little more positive control over it and makes it that much easier to wedge it between your middle and ring finger. It's got an anti-roll head that works but the flat-sided rings just aren't as large and prominent as they are on larger lights. That's good because it keeps the overall size of the light down, but it does also mean that it's a little more apt to roll than those larger ones.

The light output is selectable. The ""Ten Tap Programming"" lets you program it by clicking the power switch ten times in rapid succession. You can choose from High/Low/Strobe, which is how it's programmed when it arrives, High only, or Low/High. All that means is if you keep it on High/Low/Strobe then when you click it once it turns on High, click it twice rapidly and it turns on Strobe, and click it three times rapidly it turns on Low. On the Low/High it just allows you to alternate between those two outputs as you choose. I don't bother with any of those and just programmed it to High only. If I need a light I need all the output it has so I'm not worried about being able to use the Low mode to conserve power or the Strobe to gain attention (just rapid pushes of the momentary-on switch accomplishes the same thing as Strobe if you just need to strobe it for a few seconds). Keeping it on the High only setting is just simpler and more intuitive. Grab the light and press the button and I've got High power, I don't have to worry about if I accidentally double-click it and it starts strobing when that's not what I want. But if I'm ever in a situation where I do need to rely on the Low setting (say an extended power outage and this is the only light I have) or the Strobe setting, it's a quick process to use the Ten Tap Programming to switch over to being able to access those modes at that time.

The output on High power is admirable for such a small light. I know everyone throws around lumens and I know there is science behind it, but after having carried numerous various lights from different manufacturers over the years I don't bank on those numbers too much after seeing how they work in the real world. For one, there's no standardized process across the board for measuring the lumens, so I don't doubt that there's some room for a manufacturer to use the most appealing rating even if it's not measured the same way as their competitors. Secondly, I feel that the beam pattern and concentration plays a big part too. A highly concentrated lower lumen light is probably going to seem brighter because of it's narrow piercing beam, and be more useful when it's a pocket light like this, than a widely diffused higher lumen light that just illuminates a much wider area but isn't very concentrated. This light offers a good compromise; the ""hot spot"" (the area of the beam where the most light is projected) is fairly narrow and concentrated, but there is a good amount of spillover to also illuminate a wider area near you to a lesser degree. The beam's not adjustable (which is good, an adjustable head can risk the waterproofing) so I think the setup is optimal for the size of light and it's intended use.

Overall I'm very pleased with this light. It works great as a small pocket light while on duty, and I now carry it religiously in my jeans or shorts pocket when I'm off-duty. And I didn't mention much non-police uses, but in addition to now having a light when I'm carrying my gun off-duty (which is almost a cardinal rule in my book), I use it for all sorts of tasks around the house or in the garage when I unexpectedly need a light. It's handy having such a powerful and capable little light on me at all times and not needing to go retrieve one. Now that I've carried it long enough to see how good it is I'll probably buy several more eventually since it's so small, light, and useful. Throw one in the junk drawer, one in my nightstand, one in each vehicle, and probably another one or two for work in my gear bag and/or my rifle case for additional spares (again, a night shift officer can never have too many lights).",the united states,"June 4, 2014",tbl,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:40:34.529121,2020-10-27 22:40:34.676726,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

It is very bright and would work well to deter an attacker, is an excellent light for power outages, car troubles, everyday use. She carries it in her purse at all times, carries light in her hand when in parking lots, walking on the beach at night etc. Strobe light is excellent for signaling your location when walking on busy streets etc. I have read all the reviews, physically compared many other lights including Surefire - Protac is the superior light. Switching modes does take a little practice, but comes on in the HI mode first, which is the mode you need in an emergency use. This light is programmable to change the order that the light comes on if you wish to change the mode order.

My only con is the tailcap. It feels cheap. But I'm sure it's fine. The button is surrounded by 3 raised ""walls"" that will allow you to turn on the light and stand it up.

I have owned four of the Streamlight ProTac 2L in the past two years, and will be replacing this most recent one with a different flashlight. The problems have consistently been with a shorting connection in the tail push-button: where the light will randomly just shut off with the button clicked on. It never seems to happen with the quick-on feature, just with the constant, and it doesn't seem to matter which mode it's in (high-strobe-low). Other than this fatal flaw, it is an excellent light, but I cant depend on a light that might shut off in a life-threatening situation. I have a handful of other Streamlight models I use for work, from the tiny ProTac 1L, up to the Stinger patrol light, and their WML handgun series, and have had zero issues with those over the years.

1544,RGB95ND1UJLBT,True,Perfect EDC flashlight,"My criteria for an Every Day Carry(EDC) flashlight is simple, a rugged, decent illumination, easily portable with a simple clip.

There is also a strobe function, but I don't use it and does not accidentally gets triggered, which is a plus.

I use to carry a Surefire E1L Outdoorsman that also use one CR123A battery. Although also a very rugged light, it is bigger, not as bright and cost three times as much. The Surefire initial click is always the low then takes a second click to get the brighter setting. I prefer to have the brighter setting first.

Fits well in your hand and can be operated with your thumb, plus has multiple settings. There are other “more aggressive” style tactical flashlights out there, but they typically cost more and are not a sleek as the Streamlight 88031 Protac Tactical Flashlight 2L. This is the very flashlight (along with the 1L version) that we recommend in our Texas CHL classes at DoubleActionCHL.info. My recommendation is that you buy several and keep them where you have quick access to them. You never know when you will need a good quality bright flashlight, and of course, make sure to have one on your person.

I had to try the AA battery out. there is a spring loaded plate inside of the flashlight that allows for the AA to fit. Once you have installed the AA there is not rattle from the smaller diameter of the AA battery. It is a great option for when your CR123 goes dead and you can only find AA's.

1653,R1OBWUF8JPXH5S,True,"Big light, from a small package.","UPDATE Not fragile at alI! I have dropped this thing several times, and I can't understand why people have such a hard time with the tail switch. Its simple, and firm enough to not turn on accidentally.
I think this light will please you.
I have tried many lights in this size and price range and I think this is a good value.
The tail cap switch is easy to use and will not accidently turn on. You may need a few trys at first, but its not hard and a previous reviewer explains it well, press and click =bright - press twice and click =strobe - press three times and click =dim.
As you now know it has a strobe mode let me say that its really no problem to bypass it and go to dim, and I assume most people will just click on, and off, never concerning themselves with either dim or strobe. Its also possible to press down without clicking to use the light in either mode briefly and release when you are through.
You get plenty of bright light from this little tool. I can do what I need easily with the dim setting which is similar in brightness to the Streamlight Microstream which I also own and reviewed. If you like check it out.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00143JZ08/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01

1666,R38BEZ8GCVSDG2,True,Backup Flashlight,"While I keep a tiny flashlight on my keyring, I like to keep this pen sized flashlight in my purse for those times when a little more light is needed. The light has three modes that you switch between on its switch. It has a low, high, and strobe. I use all three modes. Low is good enough to get around a campsite or a darkened room without ruining your night vision. High is great for spotlighting things in the dark, but it is so bright I would be careful to not point it at anyone. You don't want to hurt people's eyes. The strobe I have used to help people find me at night or to warn away cars from my vehicle while on the side of the road. I was not sure if I would use a strobe feature in a flashlight, but I am glad to have it. It is possible to disable the strobe if you decide you'd rather not be bothered with it.

The only negative that I can see about this light is that it is too tactical looking for me. I get funny looks from people if I pull it from my purse when there is no lighting emergency.

1696,RCE9KSOIU0P6D,True,awesome flashlight,I purchased this flashlight about one month ago. It took about a week to get to me here in Iraq. I was a little dissapointed at first when I opened the box and saw how small it really was. But I opened it up and installed the batteries to test it out. First impression: Wow! This thing is bright. The beam is very strong and crisp. I could not believe a light this small could be so bright. My co-workers were very impressed. Everyone else started looking for flashlights that would be brighter than mine. They were spending between 70 to 170 dollars for these 300 lumen flashlights. But the streamlight was just as bright as their expensive ones. The dim setting is very conveniant for saving battery when you dont need to blind someone. I'm still not sure what i would use the strobe setting for other than playing around. It also comes with a belt holster which comes in handy. Even if you dont wear a belt you can still put your light in it to keep it protected. I am very impressed with my flashlight and would definately buy it again.,the united states,"January 20, 2011",Rome,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:42:36.687657,2020-10-27 22:42:36.829280,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1751,R2YH0ZDVZPPHWF,True,wow. get one and you'll never go back,"Quit living In the dark. This Is hands down the best flashlight ive ever owned. Its quality and usefulness are unbeatable. First off It fits clipped in your pocket so nicely it aint even noticable. Its extremely potent for its size, on high It lights up my 100 yard shooting range. And flexible, with the low setting it runs for 50 continuous hours. That is unheard of. For those of you on the fence about It because of the kind of batteries It takes QUIT WORRYING, Im a elevator mechanic I work In the dark every day and use this light every. Single. Day. Its batteries last forever. I mean It, the last set lasted from november 8-jan 4. That 2 MONTHS out of one set of batteries! 2 batteries cost 5 bucks. Yes that Is less than a fancy Starbucks drink every 2 months for me. Which ,by the way, Is much cheaper to use than that aaa light your looking at that eats batteries like candy. and dont worry about the low lumen count on the low setting, it Is more than enough for 95% of times you need a light. When It aint high setting Is a hand torch. The feature not highlighted enough that sets this light apart from all the rest is it is SOLID STATE power regulated! That means its the same exact brightness from fresh batteries until completely dead batteries! Again almost nobody else can say that! Normal lights only get to make the claimed lumens for the first 5 minutes afterwards its constantly gettin dimmer, not so with this light. Quit looking and order this thing.

1782,R1JLJFJ1KI11C7,True,DO NOT BUY! COMPLETE TRASH,"This product is now complete garbage! DO NOT BUY!

I have two ProTac 1L-1AA flashlights that I purchased last July, they work FANTASTIC!

I bought another one in preparation of Hurricane Irma, and was disappointed to find that I could not change the TenTap settings, one of my favorite Streamlight features.

I called Service and they said to return it to Amazon.

I received a SECOND ProTac 1L-1AA from Amazon and it had the same issue, I could not change the TenTap settings on this flashlight either.

I called service and this time I was told to try switching out the tail caps from one of my working flashlights with the one on my new flashlight.

This is where it gets weird.

The tail cap from my old flashlight, does not seem to fit the new flashlight. It screws in but when fully screwed in I cannot turn the light on or off. If I slightly loosen it, the flashlight works, but I am unable to set the TenTap to HIGH ONLY mode.

I then tried to put the new tail cap on my old flashlight and it wouldn't screw in all the way, it stays slightly protruded. However, even with the new cap on my old flashlight, my TenTap setting of HIGH ONLY stayed set, which leads me to believe that the TenTap settings are stored on the flashlight, not on the tail cap.

The service representative said I had two options, I could return the flashlight to Amazon AGAIN or pay out of my own pocket to send it into Streamlight.

I'll just be buying a Fenix flashlight instead that can actually function properly, if two different flashlights of the same model aren't working, it is probably a widespread production issue with Streamlight.

The build quality is lightweight but not cheesy. The body feels thin and is devoid of any checkering. I use this light for around the house and it works fine for that purpose. Small and light enough to clip in the front pocket without getting in the way. I really like the tail cap switch. Comes on in high mode. Quick off/on and it comes on as strobe. Quick off/on again comes on in low mode. Runs off 2x CR123a batteries. Light gets VERY hot when run a long time in high mode! It's rated for 180 lumens on high. I have two of these and I've noticed a huge difference in the hotspot uniformity. One looks like a little milky way galaxy and the other is fine. I haven't done a drop test but I suspect with such a lightweight build quality it would not stand up to the abuse.

This light is made for massive close range flooding. I've lit up back yards like it's daylight with this light. I've had other coppers say ""holy bleep"" when i turn on my light in a dark yard or during a traffic stop. They're jealous their light's not this bright lol. For what I use it for it's perfect, big time bright flooding over a small radius.",the united states,"July 27, 2016",Dennis,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:43:47.341790,2020-10-27 22:43:47.487402,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

1831,R32G46TXZ411EA,True,Fantastic Broad Beam and Throw Combined. Highly Recommend.,"This is a great high end flashlight that performs as advertised. I changed the default setting (low-high-strobe) easily with the Ten-Tap feature so it comes on at low, a second tap changes to medium, and a third changes to high. High is awesome! The downside to my personalized setting is the loss of the strobe feature, which is small tradeoff for my intended use. Not only does this Streamlight Pro Tac HL4 have fantastic throw, there is a also a very broad beam that surpasses that of my other high end lights. This is probably due to the glass lens which resembles a fresnel screen in an SLR camera. This broad beam is great for any search application as there is very high illumination of the immediate surrounding area as, well as a very long distance illumination. I highly recommend this flashlight, and as a retired L.E.O. wish that there was something comparable in my law enforcement years, because this could brightly illuminate vast areas, such as warehouses, ship yards, parking lots, alleys, woods, etc.",the united states,"October 16, 2016",Rich C. in SC,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:43:47.493388,2020-10-27 22:43:47.639994,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The high is very bright, almost too bright for some situations, that is why I am glad there is a low setting. The strobe is perfect if you need to disorient someone or get someone's attention.

2085,R2JMDITRYO7PIA,True,A lot of light in a small affordable package.,Very impressed with this little light as it produces a very bright beam for something not much bigger than your thumb.

I wanted small, lightweight ease of use and bright. I had a budget but not my first concern. This little guy meets and exceeds all expectations. VERY bright for its size and certainly enough light for the role its plays in my EDC. I was initially turned off by the 3 functions, i wanted basic on/off but after receiving the light i find it incredibly easy and somewhat useful. I can't speak to the battery life considering its only used when i need it rather than consistent every day use however based on my experience with other lights of the type, i don't think it will be an issue.

2097,RT7OVDO22UPN9,True,Amazing flashlight!,Streamlight has done it again. This light is just amazing. I am a fan of their products this is my fourth streamlight and all I them are still in working order. I am a patrol officer and I wanted a second light while on duty so I purchased this light to carry in my pocket. I carry the Strion HL on my belt. I wanted a light that was bright but also had the strobe feature. What I like is that I can make the light turn on in bright mode only so that I don't accidentally turn on low or strobe mode. This light is so bright it lights up a vehicle better than the spotlight on the cruiser. I would recommend this light.

2098,R3950IAHB27WBN,True,Worst Stremlight product I have ever used...,"It appears to me that many of these 4 and 5 star reviews are for a different older model. Even the pictures are not showing this light (see all the ones with a bezel that is even with the body). THIS model, the HL-X had a wide bezel that protrudes approx an 1/8 in all around past the body of the ligtht.

So, I don't like it. Here's why.

1. 1000 Lumens my rear end. Comparing this to several of my other lights I would put it in the 6-800 range.

2. The ability to select the light mode is imprecise at best. Even crappy Chinese Fenix lights have a better system.

3. The quality of the light and it it's throw is far inferior to what I expected from this light at this price. If you are looking for a replacement for your Stinger, this one is not it.

4. It's huge. Yes, it takes an 18650 battery but this light is so bulky in comparison that it will not fit nicely in a pocket or belt. Not an EDC light.

Is it a terrible light? Not really. But for this price and as ""streamlight"" I expected way better. You can get the same quality for half the price in a lesser brand. And no, I would not trust my life or safety to the performance of this light.

And as I was packaging it up for return... wonder of wonders... made in China.

2099,R2WMD4DTLQJU3B,True,GREAT flashlight for Every Day Carry,"By far my favorite EDC flashlight! I first received one of these flashlights as a gift for christmas and I carried it with me everywhere. It is slim enough to be carried in front pocket or rear pocket without weighing you down or adding too much bulk to your pants. There are 3 modes to the flashlight and they take a little bit of practice in order to get used to them, they are: High, Low, and Strobe.

I also like that the clip is removable, this allows you to place it in a different spot on the flashlight or to be removed all together. The sides of the flashlight near the front are also squared off, this helps keep the flashlight from rolling away if you set it on a flat surface.

I lost the first one I received as a gift so I purchased one myself. I lost that second one (but later found it) so I purchased a third one. My losing the flashlight isn't a fault of design but more so my clumsiness.

Now that I have 2 I keep one of my truck and the other in my backpack, I don't carry in my pocket anymore as I don't want to lose another flashlight.",the united states,"June 26, 2016",Jordan Jacob,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:46:03.212352,2020-10-27 22:46:03.362948,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I use it when walking my dog at 5a every morning in my small town where street lights are few and far between and some of our morning jaunts involve a pitch-dark golf course. I've gone through a bunch of lights, searching for perfection. This one isn't it, but it's closer than I've ever come. It runs on either a single AA or a CR123, and both fit in the same place without anything to alter, remove or install. With the CR123, you get a claimed 350 lumens, and it sure looks that bright. There are lower settings and they are useful in various settings. I knocked off a star because of the idiotic way you change among the alternative brightness settings. You have to switch to off, then push the tailcap a certain number of clicks, quickly, then a final push to hold the setting. You also alter the mapping with a series of button pushes, NINE in one case. This can't be the best they could come up with.

Con: I wish they had an additional mode I could put it in. I would like a mode where momentary on/off is hi beam and click on and off is strobe. If an intruder breaks into my home at night I would use this mode. High beam on then off then move. Repeat. High beam on, see intruder, just press harder for the click on strobe.

2216,R5K0FP8WVCSPF,True,I expected better than mediocre quality from Streamlight.,"When my “go to” light went missing in action, I decided to try the Streamlight ProTac HL 750 as a replacement, based on that company's good reputation, but I was so disappointed with what I received that I packaged it up and sent it right back.

The first thing that I noticed was the lightweight feel of the flashlight. The chassis walls are thin and do not inspire confidence. The threads are coarse and gritty, even after careful cleaning.

As one other reviewer noted, CR123 batteries rattle noisily within the flashlight body. This annoyance is not a result of any defect or bad design; it is the result of CR123s being slightly narrower than the 18650 rechargeable batteries this flashlight can also use. Flashlight manufacturers who make their lights wide enough for 18650s do so knowing that the CR123s will be smaller. However, many manufacturers deal with this by either including a plastic sheath to use with CR123s to prevent rattling, or engineer the spring tension within their flashlights to do so. Streamlight chose to do neither, thus the annoying rattle. Is this a big deal? Of course not, and if it had been the only thing that I did not like about this light I would have fashioned a sheath of my own, or wrapped a little tape around CR123s to silence them, and carried on.

But this was not the only thing that I did not like. Which brings me to:

Beam quality. The Streamlight 88040 ProTac HL 750 beam consists of a tight hot spot with a ringy, inconsistent spill. The tight hot spot is neither good nor bad; that is just a matter of taste and preference. However, the “ringy” corona is a different story. It is not terrible, nor is it bad enough to have make my decision to return the flashlight. It was just the last straw.

2222,R24ORY1CYPKVR,True,Epic failure after 20 minutes of use — hand-held light with a strange control issue...,"Updated review:
Downgrading to one star. Like several other reviewers (whom I mistakenly ignored when purchasing this flashlight) this flashlight suffered a catastrophic failure just one week after being received. I used it for less than a total of 20 minutes and yet the brightness of the flashlight is now less than 25% of the reputed 1000 lumens. I did not drop it, kept it in the case when not in use, and turned it on for no more than 2 minutes at a time. When it worked (that is - for the first few days) it was nice and bright. But it suddenly and inexplicably stopped shining at the published lumens. (Just to make sure it wasn’t stuck on the low light setting, I activated the low light - it was then no brighter than a tea light!) I have $5 flashlights that are more reliable (and now brighter!) than this one. This is the first and last Streamlight product that I will invest in. Very disappointing.

Original review soon after product was received:
Solid construction. Very bright light. Clip is awkward and thin. Gets pretty hot. My biggest beef with this is the alternate settings - strobe and low light. The triple-click control is incredibly difficult to execute and frequently takes three or four tries to get the timing just right... Thankfully, I don't need either strobe or low light, so just leave it on the default/single-click (bright) setting.",the united states,"December 6, 2017",John D.

2270,R426FTUCK1ZB9,True,not impressed,"I'll be honest with you guys, I am not too impressed by the Streamlight. I picked up both the ProTac HL 3 and the HL 2 to compare with my TakLite Apollo & Poseidon.

The Streamlight is definitely bright BUT the light is very concentrated in the middle of the output. This is also called a hot spot. Outside of the hot spot, you have rings, artifacts, and generally a lot of spill. My TakLite doesn't have any of that..it's just a consistent display of light. You can see the attached photo (not mine, found it on google) to show what I mean.

Overall build quality is decent but like I said...just not what I was expecting. I own a lot of these UltraFire flashlights and it's absolutely comparable. The streamlight has some better defined knurling and perhaps a little bit more weight to it but it's not the knight in shining armor I was expecting.

2342,R3PHR3S10DG37F,True,"Purchased one a year ago, recently malfunctioning badly","Negatives: I purchased one of these flashlights a year ago for frequent carry, but infrequent use. I have carried it nearly daily, but only used it on a handful of occasions. It has been subject to a little rough treatment in my pocket, but nothing outlandish, nor has it ever even been dropped. It recently began malfunctioning badly (light only works intermittently at best). If you plan to use it lightly it may work okay for you, but let's be real about one thing: nobody buys a tactical flashlight for anything short of tough use. Repairing submarines for a living I no longer carry this as I sure as hell wouldn't bet my life on it working when I need it. Also, this light gets extremely hot when left on high for more than about a minute. I'll be placing my faith in an American made maglite for the time being.

2343,R3MDW6UH76RZ6Q,True,Best of both worlds!,"I own the protac 1L, 2L, and a 360 lumen surefire. The surefire was way too big for EDC, the 1L was a bit too short to use as an impact weapon (I wear large size Mechanix) and the 2L was a bit longer than needed for impact use. Neither the 1L or 2L could match the power of my surefire, but had good battery life and didn't heat up much; all three required CR123 batteries that had a nasty habit of going dead on long trips when I would forget to pack back ups. The Duel Fuel strikes a perfect balance between the 1L & 2L in length (in order to accommodate AAs) being long enough to strike with but not taking up too much pocket real estate, and maintaing the slim profile of the 1L and 2L. The most impressive thing about this light is how bright the high mode is, rivaling my surefire for both intensity and spread. The big selling points are the new S clip that allows you to choose bezel up or down in the pocket and use it as a headlamp on a hard hat or baseball cap, the output, and of course the ability to use cheap and commonly available AA batteries at half (but still bright) power. The only real downside is that this bad boy gets sizziling hot and eats through a CR123a very, very fast necessitating the use of low mode when high isn't needed, and making the AA compatibility very handy. Overall it's my new EDC and a great value.",the united states,"April 2, 2017",KnifemakingPrepper,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:48:23.236767,2020-10-27 22:48:23.360932,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2346,R30N1DHOCQDAD8,True,Great flashlight,"This just arrived yesterday and I could not be happier with this purchase. Very bright. Easy to use. Tried it out on the tree line about 50 yards from my front door. Lit everything up like it was day. I bought this to replace a Mag-Lite LED XL100 that finally bit the dust and stopped working. The Steamlight is larger but then it's also 10x brighter. Easy to go from full on to strobe to low light. I do like the clip on the side. Fits well and snug in the pocket of my cargo shorts. I haven't tried to belt holster yet but on examining it it seems well made and fit the flashlight tight but not overly so. It does heat up at the light source but that's to be expected for such a powerful light. The body of the flashlight remains cool. It would have been nice to be able to adjust the focus from a flood to a narrow beam but that's not a deal killer.

Addendum: Well, this flashlight just stopped working. No rough treatment, new batteries. It just stopped. Contacted customer support so will see how that works.

I registered this flashlight at Streamlight then contacted Customer Service online. I was emailed instructions on returning it to them to repair or replace. It was found that the on/off switch was faulty and was replaced. From the time I contacted Customer Service to getting it back was about a week. Was able to do all this without having to deal with a person and without any hassle.

In the evenings after sundown and dinner, we ride in a vehicle up and down the main ranch road and spotlight small animals, i.e. hogs. This light will light-up a huge area for me. It is amazing. It is as bright as the high beams on a half ton truck. It runs on 4 x CR123 batteries, which cost $1.25 each. Expensive. It may last about 2 hours on a new set of four batteries, dimming a little as the batteries drain over 2 hours. So I use the flashlight intermittently to save batteries and $$. Another light I also use for this purpose is the Stanley FatMax SL10LEDS 10 Watt Lithium Ion rechargeable LED pistol grip spotlight. Available at Amazon. The Streamlight floodlight is brighter than the Stanley spotlight for distances up to 75 yds. The Stanley shines a small light a little further.

2457,RX3KPHQR1DTRU,True,Not at all impressed with the Streamlight Pro Tac series,"The only thing i like about this light is the ability to us AS or CR123/RCR123 batteries. The body is way to thin, I feel like I might crush it just holding it. The body is WAY to smooth making it very slippery to hold. The optics are good. The clip is very weird it doesn't seem to fit on anything but the edge of a pants pocket. It doest ""latch"" at all and can slip easily off a belt it hung externally. In my opinion the clip is almost useless. The tail switch is junk, it's way to touchy, sticks out really far beyond the base so you can't stand the light up on end, and acts flaky if the base cap isnt secured very tightly (light just shuts off randomly). The actual button under the rubber on the tail switch is tiny which makes finger placement feel ""wobbly"" and awkward. I have Fenix & Klarus lights that I have been using for years and are built WAY better than this Streamlight...and have a lot more features. The only thing really do like about this light is the double tap strobe activation of the tail switch. That's why I am currently carrying this light with my sidearm....until I find something better.

I've purchased this light twice, once in March 2014 and again in July 2014. I was happy with the light output, although it seems to eat up high-end batteries quickly. It was also happy with the relatively small size and light weight.

However, this light has an Achilles' heel: the retaining clip.

Soon after purchasing the light in March, I found it on the ground next to where I had been sitting. I placed it back in my pocket, using the retaining clip to secure it to the inside of my pocket. A few hours later, I once again found the light on the ground. This phenomenon occurred a few more times over the course of a month until the light became lost for good.

Because I was happy with the light output, I decided to purchase a second penlight when it went on sale on Amazon. The new light also fell out of my pocket several times even though it was tightly secured to the inside of my pocket.

Unfortunately, after only a few weeks of use, this second light also became lost for good.

Suffice to say, the retaining clip on this light is much too loose. In fact, I've had the entire clip detach and remain clipped to my pocket when pulling the light out.

It looks like they updated the design from some of the older lights that I have. I like what they have done, this one has checkering in stead of serrations on the battery cap and they give you a much firmer grip. One thing to note, with streamlight products they use the battery very efficiently so they work like new right up until the battery dies. The beam doesn't get dimmer until about 30 seconds before it dies. One thing I noticed is that when the battery is getting weak there is a momentary delay of the beam when you push the button. I thought it might be a defective light but I changed batteries and it fixed the issue. So consider that your ""low battery"" indicator.

It has a white light beam and I was able to reach about 50 yards with it using the AA batteries. It reached further but I wouldn't try to use it much further. I wouldn't consider it a for a weapon light. With a cr123 the beam is brighter but I haven't tested the range with it yet.

Overall it's a great light, like everything I have from them and I'll buy at least one more for in my car.",the united states,"December 26, 2017",patrick,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:50:45.159106,2020-10-27 22:50:45.289758,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2607,R19LECDSQH3YD1,True,Nice Flashlight,"I almost gave this four stars because of the piece of paper they place in the battery tube with out any info that I could find. I want to thank the folks who responded to my question about this piece when it didn't work with the batteries included and brand new ones that I had. I had a hard time getting the ""warning"" info out of the tube after putting the batteries in a couple of times. I ended up using a bamboo skewer to get it out. There should be some warning that the paper is in the tube because I have never had this problem with any of the lights I have owned through the years.
Now, the light puts out a ton of light and illuminates the woods behind my house. It's light and compact with a nice sturdy clip and holster.

2610,R8QBM4SKDAXCM,True,Could be my all time favorite light!!!,"I have been playing with flashlights since i was probably 5 years old( I am 51). They have come a long way! I have a Streamlight stylus Pro 2aaa, and I use it everyday at work. I thought it was just about perfect, but I would have liked a high and low setting. I looked around and just couldn't find one that would match the Streamlight quality. Then I ran across the Pro Tac 2aaa. I ordered it and it arrived today. After playing with the different modes, I have to say it is a little closer to perfection. It took me a little time to figure out how to select the different modes available, but I think I have it down, now. Build quality is fantastic! Get one while you can..

PROS:
just a little bigger than the stylus pro
3 pretty good modes
great build quality
30 plus hours on low

CONS:
mode selection is a little confusing at first
could live without the strobe feature, and wish I could get to low without going through strobe",the united states,"June 9, 2012",S.

This flashlight has a very good spot pattern which I can easily identify something at 300-400 ft, it has somewhat of a tiny flood pattern which I like. Here's the bad news, (Problem #1) The Ten tap is garbage, the interface on this is very slow ,if you're trying to run through the settings fast, this becomes very tedious. Unlike the interface systems of Fenix, olight ,ThruNite , Nightcore and wow tech. You can move through those settings lightning fast (Problem # 2) I used two different lumens meters to check the Candela. My findings were just under 2000 lumens( with Streamlight batteries) that's not an issue for what I use it for. This is a great flashlight at a phenomenal price point.

2845,R2AG04WJBFNT6M,True,Great flashlight but bad battery,"Great flashlight but bad battery. I really like the usb charge port versus the traditional stream light docking charger because there are usb chargers everywhere. I really like the flood and brightness of this flashlight.

However, the battery that comes with the flashlight really sucks. I did not scientifically test the battery by leaving the flashlight on till it runs out. I am a mechanic and use the flashlight to look at vehicles and peak at bolts and nuts I need to remove. The battery never makes it past lunchtime and it stays on the charger for most of the time.

I really need to buy a second battery for this thing. My other flashlights I've had in the past, before i lost or broke them, would last for days with the same kind of usage.

Slightly disappointed because I couldve gotten a Maelstrom Regen MMR-X which is almost as bright with the same kind of flood, with a much better battery.

2861,R3VNRCX3076ISM,True,Great Light,"I was skeptical at first because it was a 600 Lumen small flashlight, but it works great. Its like a mini Spot light. Only difference is, the beam is non adjustable, which is fine because it throws out the same amout of light if you were able to tighten up the beam or not. It gets a little warm after a couple of minutes of use but I guess thats from the amount of lumens coming out of it. I have had it on for about 25 minutes straight while boating at night with no issues. Only problem i see is trying to use the dimmer light on it is pretty challenging. I wouldnt mind prolonging the life of my light when I dont need the full 600 lumen. I grade it an ""A"".

I used that E1E pocket light almost daily for 9 years before it finally gave up the ghost. Now, after about 3 months of using the Streamlight 1L-1AA on an everyday basis, can safely say I traded up with this light.
As a heavy equipment mechanic, I use the light multiple times a day to light up small and hard to get areas, and the beam has been more than adaquate for this task. I also work as an Uber driver in the evenings, and using this light on high power to make out house address numbers from the car very convenient. I also appreciate the ability to use either 123A or cheaper AA batts. While I usually use the 123A batts due to the better power and run time, I haven't had any problem at all with regular AA batts.
My only complaint with the flashilight has been that the finish on the light isn't very strong. 3 months worth of pocket carry has worn a good deal of finish off the edges.

Since the light got mainly positive reviews, and was about half the price of the Surefire, I wend ahead and ordered it. I fell in love after first use. The tailcap is great since you don't have to twist it for a constant on. And the click-to-change setting is really easy to use. I kept the default setting of High/strobe/low. I ordered an Olight 1in light mount for it for my rifle. Went on without a single issue. The whole unit is installed very securely. Can't complain one bit about it. As for the whole Surefire vs Streamlight debate, I've now owned both. And both are great quality products. The surefire is a bit smaller, but costs a good dea; more. This light is a lot brighter, but has noticibly more weight to it. So it really comes down to personal preference. I'm happy with the Streamlight. My wife is happy with my Surefire.

3481,R1Y29JJOTX8MHC,True,My Favorite Flashlight Now,"Wow. Caught it on sale and bought it. This is my 2nd Streamlight, 1st one is the Pen Light which is good too. This flashlight is great, fits in your palm or can fit in pocket. I like the fact it can use 2 different battery sizes. Im new to that 3amp battery but its small and pack a punch. Quality construction. I first tested the AA battery, and 150 lumens, it was brighter than my double AA Maglite. i waited latter in night to test 3amp battery. WOW, this sucker is bright, I'm impressed. Just wish the small battery was a rechargeable battery with charger like some other flashlights offer.

3507,R283T0P6GZ0R9S,True,DON'T BUY IF YOU INTEND TO USE THE CLIP FOR CARRYING,"This is the 2nd Pro Tac 2L I have owned and I want to say first of all, that I love the flashlight, or I would have went with a different model/brand after losing my last one in an attic doing electrical work. So I just opened the package on my new replacement and the 1st thing that struck me is the pocket clip looks different on this one. Just eyeballing it I could tell that it didn't seem to fit correctly on the flashlight and it was a totally different design from the older one. The lip on the end of this one is totally flat where it catches your pocket so you have to reach down with your 2nd hand and pull the clip open to then push the light down with your 1st hand. So that just mildly annoyed me but wasn't the deal breaker. The deal breaker is that every time I tried to seat the clip all the way home in my pocket, the darn thing falls off the flashlight. I don't mind paying $40 bucks for a quality flashlight, but this makes me mad. It wasn't like this on my older one I purchased 6 months ago.

3525,R199X3JQJWFV9B,True,Almost perfect,"There are two things I would change with this light. The ribs toward the bezel are flat on three spots to keep the light from rolling, but are still proud of the light body. The clip sits right on these ribs and makes the light snag a little bit when putting it into your pocket. Streamlight should either make the flat spots actually flat, or shorten the clip a few millimeters so it doesn't sit on the ribs. Second change is that the light does tail stand, but the button is a little bit proud, so the light wobbles when used that way. The button needs to be recessed another millimeter. I've been carrying this light every day for 4 months now and have no plans to replace it. Love the ten tap programming and elected to set it to high only.

3549,R37LOKH4MKAGH7,True,Impressive,"I not only ordered the HL 4 but also ordered the Streamlight 18650 barriers with a charger knowing that this light would eat up the CR-123 battlers if used at 2,200 lums. When I first observed the light I was disappointed on ther frosted lens. See I own many hi lum Streamlight flashlights and was a custom to the cristal clear lens on all my models. But while holding the light I fell in love with the rubber grip, none of my other Streamlights had this feature. When I first turned it on I now understood the concept of the frosted lens. This is night and day compared to the HL3 which has such a bright center spot, the HL4 does not light this way. It is more a flood light or area light which offers a very even pattern. Used at 2,200 lums it turns night into a bright sunny day. It is the most even light pattern I have ever seen. After using this for several days I can honestly say it is my first choice when grabbing a flashlight.

3568,R27K4RVPCJJH8Q,True,"Honestly, stars are misleading for the price","Just got this light. Got to say, nothing special here about this light. Not going to say I hate it, just that it's very disappointing.

Pros:
-It's a one bulb LED light
-It looks very tactical, so if you're going for tactical, durable gear for your vest, this will work (clip is helpful also)
-Belt holster works fine, nice wide belt loop for work belts
-People say this light is very durable, with long lasting batteries. I'll take their word for it in my rating

Cons:
-Lumens are not impressive at all. This is really why we buy these ""hummingbird"" style lights right? Super small size with intensely bright LED lights. For the size of it, it puts out as much light as you would expect of a cheapy light this size
-Light options: Who's going to use the low light, especially since the bright light is not very bright? If you want to put someone into seizure, then the strobe is handy hahaha. Could come in handy for signaling over long distances i guess. Really they should have skipped these features and focused on the quality of the light itself.
-Cost vs. Value of Product... this light loses. This is a $15-$20 light max. I've seen much better small LED tactical lights for much cheaper at various places like Home Depot, Autozone, liquor stores, even Walmart etc.. These have anywhere from 5-10 LED bulbs, SUPER BRIGHT, long lasting & perfect for tactical. I think because they can put *tactical* in the name, they thought it was worth more...
-Made in China (This really should be on every Amazon listing. Nothing against China, but I am American and believe in supporting my country's products. I wrote to Amazon CEO Jeffrey Bezos and his secretary replied back. She spoke very politely that this might be addressed, but I'm still having to roll the dice every time I buy a product on here. Here is another example of how this would have saved me time, frustration and money)

Summary:
If this light were $15 with free shipping, I would give it a 5 star rating. You get what you pay for, but $40 for a regular old light? I don't think so.

3636,R3G6KV20T709DQ,True,Most EXCELLENT Flashlight,"First i'd like to say that i own the Streamlight ProTac 2L and love it! Very professionally made. Length 4 5/8"" long, and 7/8"" in diameter. Fits very well in my chest pocket. I also purchased the Streamlight ProTac HL. It's length is 5 1/4"" and it's head diameter is 1 3/8"" across. Very well machined on both models. Don't expect the center of the beam on either model, to be sharp as like looking at the moon. Sitting about 8 feet from a white wall, the ProTac 2L's center beam is about 1 foot diameter and it's surrounding aureole extends to approximately 8 feet diameter. The ProTac HL's center beam is about 2 feet diameter and it's surrounding aureole extends to approximately 10 feet diameter. Both models use the expensive CR123 batteries and buying them at the local supermarket is a Sin! They wanted 13 dollars for a set of 2 batteries. Went on-line to BatteryJunction.com and bought a box of 50 which brought the price down to approximately $1.29 a battery, depending on which brand you choose. I chose the Panasonic brand because the current capacity of each cell was higher than your average battery like Duracell or EverReady. Both Flashlights are extremely bright and machined to close tolerances and would not hesitate on recommending either one.",the united states,"February 17, 2013",Matthew Swiss,5.0,0,2020-10-27 23:00:44.042074,2020-10-27 23:00:44.170132,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3886,R2SPCPSSORUO5M,True,Ridiculous light,"The shine has to be comparable to 4 new automobile brights. Its difficult to comprehend the brightness, and it is constant across the entire throw. It can brightly light the side of a 200' wide building at least, and maybe double that. The build quality is better than my stinger led hp, the threads are very smooth and clean and it feels far more rugged, and the metal more solid. I agree with some of what the negative reviewer said, other than it seeming like a chinese knock off. Everything is very tight and finished with a solid feel and smooth exterior edges.
-Although its 1/2 shorter than my stinger it seems like a larger light due to being more bulky, where as the stinger is very streamlined. It weighs significantly more as well and is difficult to carry facing up in a back pocket, as the face is heavier and will tip the light out. All this information is in the description though.
-Instead of a reflector it has a diffuser, which seems to work great, so i dont see it as a problem, though initially i was concerned since it doesnt state this anywhere. I believe this is how they achieved the even throw.
-Its capable of crown and tail standing, as well as having flat spots along the sides near the crown to lay on its side at about a 10° angle.
-As the listing states, the ten tap programing allows customization, but not full customization unfortunately.
-I have used 2 18650 3500mah batteries and they work perfectly. Just ensure your 18650s are button top, not flat or the first will not contact the positive inside the light. The automatically adjusting battery bay is very impressive and works perfectly.
-This is one hell of a light, and I assure you, youll be laughing like a lunatic the first time you go shine it around your neighborhood at night. My only concern is that its so bright as to have no practical purpose other than lighting up an entire block party.",the united states,"April 25, 2016",Viciouskev,5.0,0,2020-10-27 23:03:01.877487,2020-10-27 23:03:02.009841,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3914,RUGO3KMHVKNRC,True,Streamlight ProTac PT2L Tactical Excellent LED Flashlight,"I bought this very impressive LED flashlight almost 3-years ago and still find it to be excellent and a must have tool. Anyone considering a purchase might feel that this light is kinda expensive.

So, are there cheaper flashlights available? Heck Yes.

Can you buy a better made, brighter light, in a similar size as this Streamlight for less money? Not Likely.

Prior to purchasing this light I owned the comparable SureFire tactical flashlight. I quickly realized a person undeniably needs more than one excellent flashlight. Since the SureFire sells for three times as much as this Streamlight, I purchased this PT2L. (In the interest of full disclosure I actually bought 4 of the Streamlight units.)

If there were any drawback to this light it would be the short battery life. That is not a complaint just something to be aware of. I realized the expected battery life when I purchased these units, I consider it a fair trade off for the vast amount of light this thing expels.

Bottom Line: If you are hesitating the acquisition because of the expense, go ahead and make the purchase as you'll be glad you did. If you provide proper care this light should last your lifetime or longer.

While you are here on Amazon you might as well click over and buy the large package of the CR123 batteries as they also have an excellent price on them. And the 123 batteries have a very long shelf-life so you might as well keep a stock so you don't end up having to pay twice as much at a retail store outlet.",the united states,"September 29, 2013",U.R.Nuts,5.0,0,2020-10-27 23:03:16.041521,2020-10-27 23:03:16.169071,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3989,R1QR2A2WT9JH3P,True,Great Light But Can Get Warm,This light is as advertised. It is bright and light weight. It has a momentary on switch which is extremely nice. The only flaw I have experienced is the light gets really hot if used 10 minutes or longer. Not so hot it burns but hot enough you don't want to touch the metal casing around the bulb. The metal around the battery compartment and on/off switch do not get hot so you can operate it for longer periods of time without discomfort. Just be careful not to let your hand wander near the bulb area or it may nip you with heat. If mounting this light the heated bulb area wont matter because the bracket will be around the center of the light and the on/off switch does not get warm or hot.,the united states,"July 15, 2017",Brad,4.0,0,2020-10-27 23:03:52.797124,2020-10-27 23:03:52.928472,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

4026,RDE0O1HXXWLML,True,BEST IN ITS CLASS!,"I am a firefighter and use the Streamlight Protac HL 88040. The Protac HL is an excellent torchlight, solidly built, durable, and has a powerful ""ray gun"" 600 lumen torchlight.

The Streamlight HL features: checkering on body for a good grip, a metal clip (mine holds a 550 cord lanyard loop), anti-rollaway ability, recessed tail switch, strobe feature, a nylon holster included, slightly brighter than the Surefire P2X Fury in both low and high. The Streamlight Protac HL can be weapon mounted.

This light is very bright and has ""medium"" throw with excellent side splash. I think its a very good balance, working well indoors without too much hotspot and enough distance outside.

I find the strobe feature is useful for signaling but soldiers and lawmen like it to blind zombies. The strobe did save me once by turning away an attacking pit bull.

You have to have a light which has a low power setting so that it lasts a long time. However, the low setting is mildly annoying because it actually ""flashes"" which is misleading about moving equipment (try looking at a ceiling fan or helicopter tail rotor with it).

The included velcro holster is useful and durable. A nice touch.

The Streamlight Protac HL is unable to take rechargeable batteries at this time and in fact it voids the factory warranty. Some kind of overheat/explosion hazard. Be sure to buy USA made batteries.

Equal to the Streamlight Protac HL is the excellent Surefire P2X-B-BK Dual Output Fury, Nitecore MT26, Fenix TK21-U2, 4Sevens X7 Maelstrom, and Klarus XT11 which are all in this same category. All are excellent lights, but I think the Streamlight Protac HL is the BEST IN ITS CLASS.

4634,R2XH01LKJSZEJZ,True,One of the brightest LED tac lights currently available....,"Yes it's a very bright LED tac light (claimed 600 lumens max...) . It lacks a lanyard or lanyard attaching point. Has a pocket clip but I'm not sure you'd ever use it. The clip serves more as an anti-roll device than anything else. This light does not accept the common 18650 rechargeable battery cell, so you're stuck using nothing but CR123 batteries. This light vs. the Fenix TK series I would have to recommend the Fenix lights, for ease of operation and ability to use the 18650 cell. This Streamlight has a funky programing scheme to switch between the three available modes ( High-Strobe-Low and combinations there of....) . You'll probably wear out the end cap switch trying to change modes. The Fenix light uses a secondary button switch to easily switch between modes and settings. So yes, this is a bright LED light, but it's weird scheme for switching modes and inability to accept the 18650 rechargeable cell, no lanyard point, prove to be shortfalls that would make me look at other lights to spend my money on.",the united states,"March 29, 2013",Ham,3.0,0,2020-10-27 23:09:52.124462,2020-10-27 23:09:52.253671,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The high mode is blindingly bright, with a small hotspot in the middle that evens out over distance. Pure white light that literally fills every dark corner you point it at. It illuminated most of my backyard during testing. Strobe has its applications, just not for what I am using it for, but is still a neat feature to have. Low is the perfect amount of light for most situations.

The Ten-Tap programming feature is cool, but I do wish it was slightly more customizable as I would like a mode with high on tap one and low on tap two and no strobe.

It is not meant to be a light needed for any length of time on high but more of a light that can be used as an everyday flashlight that has the ability to throw a lot of light for a short period of time or to strobe very brightly if needed. This is to be expected since it runs on just 2 cr 123a batteries. That being said I had earlier purchased an Olight MS20-X 500 lumen light and it does indeed last quite a bit longer on high. The MS20 is of course 100 lumens less and $20 dollars more. Both are good lights but if I had to pick one it would be the Olight. I will keep the 88040 as a backup, Streamlight makes durable products.",the united states,"September 7, 2012",Lee,3.0,0,2020-10-27 23:11:13.290422,2020-10-27 23:11:13.427008,"Streamlight 88065 Pro Tac HL-X 1,000 Lumen Professional Tactical Flashlight with High/Low/Strobe Dual Fuel use 2X CR123A or 1x 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries and Holster",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06VTLLC13,,"#9,282 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
