5,R202MKC0ZAYEDX,True,"Tiny, great light quality. Enough to get you through a night out camping","Overall I'm very happy with this. I've used it for camping and working in the dark. The colour of the light on the main round lamp is great. Warm enough and bright. I haven't noticed any pwm in the dimmer modes (I'm sensitive to it). The lowest setting is a little too low for me, so I've mainly used the middle. Brighter is good and not felt the need to use turbo. It has a great field of light, very wide. The tilt adjustment gets low enough for using to see things in your lap well. Not really used the secondary white or red yet spart from testing. Very comfy. The only reason it gets 4* is because I feel it could have a larger battery. It hasn't failed me yet on a night out camping but it's got close.

6,R1PLJEDU6EJTHO,True,Probably the best lightweight rechargeable head torch available,"I was after a lightweight head torch for trecking but did not want to spend too much money. Having done a bit of research I came across the NU25. I watched a few video reviews and read lots of reviews online and took the plunge in purchasing this one.

I could not be more pleased. It is a fantastic head torch, so light that you don't really know that you are wearing it. There is no compromise on the brightness of the light and it packs a real punch in the amount of light it emits. A huge bonus is the red light option too.

It appears to be very well made and the headband is extremely comfortable.

15,R1IUFADCP7PW32,True,Richtig gute und superleichte Kopflampe!!!,"Auch hier wieder eine turboschnelle Lieferung durch den KTL-Store, einfach top! - Bei der NU25 handelt es sich um eine superleichte Kopflampe, die sich, meiner Meinung nach, in der Praxis durch eine sehr komfortable Zwei-Knopf-Bedienung (Knopf für Rotlicht + Knopf für Normal-/CRI-Licht) und durch 3 separate Lichtquellen auszeichnet. Das Hauptlicht mit max. 360 Lumen reicht bei Dunkelheit völlig aus, da sich das Lichtbild im Verhältnis zwischen Spill und Spot sehr ausgewogen darstellt. Außerdem kommt man mit den 13 Lumen beim Rotlicht ebenfalls sehr gut aus, wenn man unterwegs nicht zu stark auffallen will, aber trotzdem ein Orientierungslicht benötigt oder Tiere/Menschen nicht blenden möchte. Das CRI-Licht wird von mir eher weniger benötigt, aber schön, dass es ebenfalls vorhanden ist. Die Verarbeitung ist, trotz des Kunststoffgehäuses, wieder mal Nitecore-typisch hervorragend. Die NU25 rastet in der Winkelverstellung sauber in die entsprechenden Positionen ein und wird dann absolut sicher in der Arretierung gehalten. Als ich die Lampe bestellte, ging ich von der Lieferung einer schwarzen Version aus, allerdings kam sie in der Farbe gelb bei mir an. Zunächst war ich etwas geschockt von dieser Farbe, hatte sie aber dann doch behalten und bin froh darüber, da meine anderen Nitecorelampen alle schwarz sind und diese gelbe Version in Verbindung mit dem mitgelieferten Kopfband sogar richtig gut aussieht. Wenn man die Lampe dann noch auf einer dunkle Mütze trägt... -> „Hightech-Optik“!!!

16,R1CEVPAYXW90B8,True,Buona frontale con caratteristiche interessanti,"Presa principalmente per 2 ragioni: ricarica via USB e possibilità di blocco tasti per evitare accensioni involontarie durante il trasporto.

Il led ausiliario dedicato alla luce soffusa è ottimo, illuminazione molto ampia e sufficiente per camminare ad esempio su un sentiero in notturna. Producendo una luce appunto soffusa ma soprattutto calda, può essere utilizzato tranquillamente anche in tenda o bivacco con altre persone senza dare fastidio.

Sinceramente ho sfruttato poco il led principale che però mi ha dato la sensazione di avere una potenza, alla pratica, inferiore al dichiarato seppur comunque sufficiente. Se confrontato con altre frontali (es. Black Diamond) con valori sulla carta simili sembra fare meno luce e con meno profondità. Livello minimo praticamente inutile, decisamente troppo poco luminoso.

Led rosso a 2 intensità più flash, molto luminoso.

Molto leggera, si dimentica di averla indosso. Funzioni semplici da memorizzare e utilizzare. Per il momento mai portata al limite di batteria, utilizzata senza problemi in modo non continuativo per almeno 5 ore. Utile il fatto di poterla eventualmente utilizzare anche durate la ricarica (es. con un power bank).

Pro:
++ caratteristiche del led ausiliario
+ carica usb anche durante l'utilizzo
+ leggerezza

Contro:
- led principale meno luminoso del previsto, livello minimo praticamente inutile",italy,"February 13, 2020",Andrea C.,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:30:48.034093,2020-11-12 15:30:48.149868,NITECORE NU25 360 LM Rechargeable Headlamp,4.8,56.02,,Tools & Home Improvement,B078PH9DCB,,"#15,695 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

28,R2CG97LFPN2KK3,True,EDCライトとして最高。但し今の価格は高過ぎ、7000円程度まで下がるのを待つことをオススメします,"フラッシュライトやヘッドライトを30〜40個程度使ってきました。

今はこれが一番便利です。

軽くて小さくて余計な出っ張りも無く、

それでいて必要な照射時間を維持してくれます。

白、電球色、赤の３色に対して

ボタンが二つあるのも操作しやすい。

ボタンの硬さは誤操作しない程度に強く

丁度イイ感じです。

電球色のフラットな照射面は地図を見やすい。

白色光の照射面は、歩く先を適度に照らしてくれます。

赤の「強」は結構明るくウォーキングにも使えました。

自分としては１ルーメン１６０時間が凄く有難い。

暗いのに目が慣れれば、テント内ではコレが使いやすいし、

旅行の際は常夜灯として枕元に置いて寝てます。

好きな使い方１

フラッシュライトとして、

バンドを付けずに本体だけで持ち歩いてます。

マッチ箱サイズなのでポケットに入れても気になりません。

筒状だと簡単ではありませんが角度調整出来るので、

地面に置いたとき、ある程度照射方向を決められます。

好きな使い方２

おでこに当たる面、

蒸れ防止のためだと思うのですが、

ハニカム状のデザインで幾つか穴が開いてます。

そこに太さ３ミリのゴムロープが丁度入るので、

ヘッドライトとして使うとき、

添付されたバンドではなく、

ゴムロープを使ってます。

ペツル(PETZL) ビンディの様なイメージです。

ゴムロープだと交換も容易だし、そもそも安い！

使わない時はデイバッグに縛り付けてます。

その他、手にするまで気が付かなかった点を幾つかお伝えします。

交換用バンド

バンドを通す穴に切り欠きは無く、

おでこに当たる部分を素通しにして使います。

ペツルなどで多くみられる構造です。

その為、交換用バンドで両端が袋になっているモノ（GENTOSで多くみられるタイプ）は使えません。

ロックアウト可能

二つのボタンを同時に長押しするとロックアウトと解除が出来ます。

ロックアウト中にスイッチを押すと、

スイッチが赤くついてロックアウト中であることが判ります。

インジケータ

中央側ボタンを長押しすると、バッテリー容量が判ります。

３回点滅：５０％以上

２回点滅：１０−５０％

１回点滅：１０％未満

ご参考になれば幸いです。",japan,"June 28, 2019",ＯＪ,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:30:51.816369,2020-11-12 15:30:51.943218,NITECORE NU25 360 LM Rechargeable Headlamp,4.8,56.02,,Tools & Home Improvement,B078PH9DCB,,"#15,695 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

29,R2CT5VC8MSTZ29,True,Good concept - defective product,"I really like the size and brightness as well as all the features. Different brightness settings, red light beam, and a button lock to prevent accidental turning on in storage. However, a few months after purchasing, it no longer works. It will turn on for a second and then go out, and then refuse to turn on until after a full charge. This happens no matter how long I leave it on the charger.

So in summary - a well thought out headlamp, but I received a defective one. And so now I am left with a useless product and no return on what I spent.

30,R3PK2ORSU1XF3K,True,Great lightweight headlight.,"Awesome little rechargeable light. I am an electrician in the commercial and industrial environment and we often need light to see what we are doing because we supply the light to the rest of the trades! I bought separate hard hat clips for this light which I wish were included but this light is nice and lightweight, and it is plenty bright to get the job done. I like it because it adds almost no weight to my hard hat. Easy to recharge and very well made. Battery lasts decently long. Heavy use will require a daily charge. I usually charge twice a week.

31,R2CU785VASVJU6,True,Very pleased.,"I hope it continues to function the way it did on my first outing. I use it mainly for lighting while setting up, adjusting, and taking down telescopes, computers, and cameras for astrophotography. It has every kind of light at every light level I need. From barely giving white light through two more increases in brightness to a serious torch, and two levels of red light plus a flashing red light.

32,R1W1KW9RBSMI6K,True,Best Headlamp for UL Hiking,I previously used Black Diamond Headlamps but have been migrating all of my gear to ultra light.
