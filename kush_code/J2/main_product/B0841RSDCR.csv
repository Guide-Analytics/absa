3,R1WTGZF6DRV1OD,True,Nitecore E4K Review and Tips,"PROs:
Crazy bright for a small light
Beam profile is floody (see photo). Excellent if you prefer flood over a focused bright spot
Good mode spacing (from 2 lumens ""moonlight mode"" to 4,400 turbo)
Feels good in hand, doesn't feel bulky in pocket
Can tailstand

CONs:
Gets hot quick in turbo (ATR feature will protect from overheating by regulating temps via automatic step down to a lower brightness setting)
Tailstand not magnetized
UI may take some getting used to (See below for some tips)

USER INTERFACE TIPS:
Quick press while OFF: Shows battery level
Half second press: Power on
While ON: Hold button to access turbo (release to go back to the mode you were in)
While OFF: Double click for instant access to 2 lumen moonlight mode
While OFF: Triple click for instant access to Turbo (When in standard mode) or Strobe (When in tactical mode)

To switch between Standard and Tactical modes:
Loosen tail cap then hold down power button while re-tightening cap.

There are two ways to change brightness settings:
While OFF: Press and hold to power on and cycle through brightness levels
While ON: Double click the power button and hold on the second click to cycle through the brightness levels

Brief review:

The Nitecore E4K is an overkill 4400 lumens in a small, pocketable light. Overkill for ""normies"" like me, but this could be a great tool for search & rescue, law enforcement, and exploration. The mode spacing is great and fits my needs (2 lumens -> 50, 320, 1,050 then 4,400). 4.4k turbo mode lasts about 25 secs before stepping down to 1050 lumens.

Beam pattern is floody, to be expected because of the shallow reflectors housing the quad leds. Concrete building in photo is approx 100 meters away, but notice the light spill. Great for exploration and searching but not the best pick if you prefer a focused, ""spot"" beam.

Recommended as an EDC light?

Yes if you're outdoors a lot or if your needs require both very low and very high light output in a pocket friendly light. If you're mostly indoors or if you don't need more than 1000 lumens, then a smaller flashlight might be more practical for you (see Olight S1R Baton 2, Nitecore EC11).",the united states,"February 12, 2020",Daniel G.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:55:31.177110,2020-11-12 11:55:31.298786,Nitecore E4K 4400 Lumen high powered Flashlight with 5000 mAh rechargeable Battery and EdisonBright battery carrying Case bundle,4.5,110.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0841RSDCR,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KSOIHW2pL._AC_SY355_.jpg
4,R835NNE4VN9GS,True,2 beers in,"Cheap flashlights has been my hobby for years. Researching the reviews, looking up the cree bulbs, watching so many youtube videos, steering my way through deceptive Chinese offerings and then waiting for the ups guy so I can test them in my backyard and even camping.
But I took a job that starts at 1:30 am and its outside. A flashlight for me now is like a pen for a mortgage broker. To be honest, I've I have always wanted the tiny monster and not the knock off that I have, the price put me off. But I knew none of the lights I have would last under my new requirements.
I have always believed that nitecore was the best so I looked them up and found my match in the e4k.
You see, I also conceal carry. I have learned over the years that the weapon and holster has to be so comfortable that It disappears after a while.
With the clip, the e4k does that. I never feel it but it's always there... even at home. If I have pants on, it is with me.
That is great design.
Is it 4000 lm? Idk dont have the gear to test it. It is great at 100 yards, really great. Really wide throw. Wider than any of the other lights I have. What's cool is, the defusion is perfect, it's like turning on a light in a room. That is the right thing for EDC. At 200 yards it's not good, but critical people must be pleased I guess.
To conclude. I have had this tool on my person every day for close to a month. I really hated paying 90 bucks for it...but this is a pro grade light that has made me forget all of my other lights. Taking the battery out to charge is annoying but if I drop it in the toilet, I'm good. Triple tap for defense flash is good, but the flash is too fast to be effective. I leave it on 1000lm and hold the button down for high. I mostly hold it down to make me feel better about spending 90 bucks on a flash light. The high setting is enough for 90 % of the things I do. ....he he
I would say you would be pissed at the price... but you would NOT give it back.
It fits too well. At least for me.
Hope this helps you.",the united states,"February 14, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:55:31.302775,2020-11-12 11:55:31.432428,Nitecore E4K 4400 Lumen high powered Flashlight with 5000 mAh rechargeable Battery and EdisonBright battery carrying Case bundle,4.5,110.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0841RSDCR,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KSOIHW2pL._AC_SY355_.jpg
5,RLNQE01X4WGAI,True,Intuitive Tactical Light,"I work security at a large hotel. I needed a powerful but inconspicuous light to carry at I work. This fit the bill. it is the size of a standard tactical light but has several very useful features. First the switch is up front just below the bezel, right where your thumb rest. It is under 5"" long which makes it just right for my belt. I have one of the older Sure Fire, basket weave flashlight holsters with a little over an inch diameter opening. The light slides right in there with just the top and the switch protruding. The reflector has four LEDs. The light has 4 brightness settings and a turbo mode. No matter what mode you are in - press and hold brings on the turbo. This is as it should be. Also you can go right to turbo by clicking three rapid clicks. This mode can also be set to go right to strobe, where I have it set. The light is bright 4400 lumen in turbo. Strobe is at 4400 lumens and it is a random pattern - excellent for disorientation. It will deafeningly keep an aggressor out of your face, even in daylight.
It has one thing that, do to its design, couldn't be as I'd like it to be. It has no momentary on and there is a delay of around .4 of a second before it comes on when pressed. This I guess is to keep it from accidental activation.
The battery is charged by plugging it in with its own cord. You have to take the thing out of the light to charge it. Odd they couldn't make the light its self plug in but they didn't.
This thing is bright! In turbo mode it rivals lights twice its size. It has a flood type beam with a hot spot in the center. It gets hot fast in turbo. I use it in the 1000 lumen mode and then I can kick it into turbo momentarily at will.
For the price point and convenience of use. I would recommend this light. There are many tactical type lights out there but this one stood out to me and I like it. Your taste may vary but you might want to give this one a try.",the united states,"February 25, 2020",Imageon,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:55:31.436418,2020-11-12 11:55:31.565074,Nitecore E4K 4400 Lumen high powered Flashlight with 5000 mAh rechargeable Battery and EdisonBright battery carrying Case bundle,4.5,110.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0841RSDCR,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KSOIHW2pL._AC_SY355_.jpg
6,R13QFZ3NCKK7NY,True,Had reservations based on other reviews but this is a superb flashlight,"I'm a complete flashlight nerd and have a sad addiction to high quality flashlights including Fenix, Olight, Streamlight but mostly Nitecore. I have a selection of search and flood but mostly prefer floodlights for EDC, walking the dog (very rural area) and general usage around the home.

Another reviewer talked about the need to long press to activate the flashlight being a major issue for them. For me it's absolutely fine. Also love being able to double-click to get to lowest setting and triple-clicking to get to strobe. Long press when on takes you to turbo. The flashlight is very bright on highest settings and the flood is excellent. Love the quick strobe access when walking the dog on some of the unlit streets, makes sure to be noticed.

The belt hook (reversible) is also great, I typically hook onto my jeans pocket pointing at the ground for walking. Button is easily accessed to increase brightness or strobe.

Was concerned when I first got it that the mode switching would be problematic for me too but now I love it. Also bought the TM9K which is excellent and my favorite light. Also bought the New P30 but this E4K is my daily go-to for it's size, brightness, side button and sheer ease of use/portability.

Build quality is also excellent, I love great engineering and the fact it's a 21700 battery seals the deal for me.

Can't recommend enough. Considered buying more of them for the coming zombie apocalypse but figured I'll just buy more different lights to add to my collection - much to the chagrin of the wife.",the united states,"March 26, 2020",Troggg,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:55:31.571058,2020-11-12 11:55:31.738610,Nitecore E4K 4400 Lumen high powered Flashlight with 5000 mAh rechargeable Battery and EdisonBright battery carrying Case bundle,4.5,110.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0841RSDCR,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KSOIHW2pL._AC_SY355_.jpg
7,R3AHKF61DXOXJT,True,"7 months later, NOT HAPPY","I am a heavy diesel mechanic, and I use this light several times a day. It disappoints me to say that it is not living up to my expectations. Pressing the button to check the battery level via the blue lights usually does not work, the grippy texture on the button has long since worn off, and the battery light flickers rapidly when charging it. Furthermore, two of the LEDs have been flickering while in use, and now they do not get any brighter than what they are in the picture, so my light output has been cut in half for no real reason. I contacted Nitecore, they have been absolutely no help whatsoever. I have also contacted EdisonBright directly and they were able to let me send it in under warranty, however I will be without a flashlight for a week or so, not ideal. I have owned several Nitecore flashlights over the years and I really want to keep being a fan of them, but the lack of quality here is really making it hard. I might not buy another Nitecore flashlight again.",the united states,"October 28, 2020",Alec,2.0,0,2020-11-12 11:55:31.746589,2020-11-12 11:55:31.983955,Nitecore E4K 4400 Lumen high powered Flashlight with 5000 mAh rechargeable Battery and EdisonBright battery carrying Case bundle,4.5,110.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0841RSDCR,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KSOIHW2pL._AC_SY355_.jpg
8,R3PXQHHAJT6ATO,True,Man can this light up the night. Great edc light.,This is an amazingly bright and compact flashlight. It is made well and great for an edc light. Simple to operate interface and long battery life. I purchased it and have no regrets. I have been carrying it for about 1 month now and have had no issues. For size and ease of carry I have carried a fenix pd35 in the past. This is close to that size. But much more light/lumens. It is meant to be more of a flood light rather than a long distance tight beam/spot thrower.

9,R3C6RKP8R22O77,True,Nitecore E4K Light Blaster,"Pros: Very compact just over 17 mm or 4 5/8"" tall.
Bright! Did I say bright, 4400 lumens on turbo mode. The light dispersion is floody with a diffused hot spot. The single button interface takes a short while to get used to but I find I like it over the two button type. The light will remember what power level you have chosen and it can be accessed with a one second press of the control button. You can go directly to ultra low with two quick presses of the control button or you can go to super bright the same way with 3 quick presses of the control button. The light comes with a Nitecore NL2150HPR 5000 mah 21700 battery that is USB C rechargeable. You can also use a 18650 or two cr123 batterys with the included adapter.
Cons: As you would expect with the small size of this light it will heat up fast when used in Turbo mode. It does have thermal protection and will cut the light out put back on heating up. I am surprised at the power out put in such a small package.
I can recommend this light highly, great build quality and a super bright compact unit.",the united states,"February 15, 2020",Zoner,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:55:32.120588,2020-11-12 11:55:32.251513,Nitecore E4K 4400 Lumen high powered Flashlight with 5000 mAh rechargeable Battery and EdisonBright battery carrying Case bundle,4.5,110.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B0841RSDCR,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KSOIHW2pL._AC_SY355_.jpg
