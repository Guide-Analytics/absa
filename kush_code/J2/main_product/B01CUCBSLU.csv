0,R2N5S52Q2D71RU,True,Su luz alcanza Mas de lo que tus ojos pueden ver,"Impresionate.
Segun la informacion del certificado del fabricante Ilumina a 1300 metros reales de distancia. Yo la he probado a distancias aún mayores y todavia ilumina mucho, he tenido que usar prismaticos para ver lo que iluminaba al otro lado de un barranco porque estaba tan lejos que solo veía un circulo blanco. Si necesitas algo para vigilar una finca grande sin tener que acercarte a un posible peligro esta pedazo de linterna es una gran elección. Necesitarás 4 baterías 18650 de buena calidad ya que no las trae incorporadas , pero a este precio interesa mucho",spain,"October 28, 2017",cmlcleden,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:37:53.690255,2020-11-12 15:37:53.834955,"Acebeam K70 CREE XHP35 HI LED Output 2600 Lumens Throwing 1300 Meters 6 Brightness Levels for Hunting,Searching, Securing,Caving",3.5,429.05,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01CUCBSLU,"{'product dimensions': '20.32 x 7.62 x 5.08 cm; 840 Grams', 'item model number': 'K70', 'is discontinued by manufacturer': 'No', 'color': 'Black', 'size': 'K70', 'length': '20.6 centimeters', 'weight': '2 Kilograms', 'width': '8.8 centimeters', 'bulb type': 'LED', 'batteries included?': 'No', 'brand': 'ACEBEAM', 'item weight': '840 g'}","#849,256 in Sports & Outdoors (See Top 100 in Sports & Outdoors)

4,R2SB0QIL35XA8Y,True,Great until it broke,"Of the popular 4x18650 throwers I think this has the best UI, which is why I bought it. Unfortunately the light made a high-pitched squealing noise and after less than a hour of use would not increase output beyond the bottom three powers. You could also see a portion of the LED was no longer lighting up and had a black/dead spot. I went back and forth with Acebeam support directly on this for almost a week before just deciding to return it for a refund and go with something different. It had potential to be a 5 star product if not defective, but giving it 3 stars since it was great until it broke and I'm sure getting a replacement would have bene quick.",the united states,"July 18, 2017",jbauch357,3.0,0,2020-11-12 15:37:54.262968,2020-11-12 15:37:54.402080,"Acebeam K70 CREE XHP35 HI LED Output 2600 Lumens Throwing 1300 Meters 6 Brightness Levels for Hunting,Searching, Securing,Caving",3.5,429.05,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01CUCBSLU,,"#849,256 in Sports & Outdoors (See Top 100 in Sports & Outdoors)

9,R9Z65M2VEZ4M5,True,Nice light but a flood/thrower is better.,"So this light has a nice ring for controlling the brightness and strobe. It is made well. I have many very expensive lights, including collector lights. I'm a flashaholic. I bought this solely for its vaunted ability to throw the beam a far distance. Well, that feature on a light I find somewhat overrated. Yes, it does throw far, but when looking at something lit with it hundreds of feet away, it's next to impossible to make out what it is lighting up.",the united states,"August 31, 2017",MR,3.0,0,2020-11-12 15:37:54.969949,2020-11-12 15:37:55.101589,"Acebeam K70 CREE XHP35 HI LED Output 2600 Lumens Throwing 1300 Meters 6 Brightness Levels for Hunting,Searching, Securing,Caving",3.5,429.05,,Tools & Home Improvement,B01CUCBSLU,,"#849,256 in Sports & Outdoors (See Top 100 in Sports & Outdoors)
