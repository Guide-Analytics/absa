0,R1K2DGXB4ROURJ,True,Buy it,"Great pocket light. Good light disbursement, simple operation, compact. Not super bright, but plenty for its typical uses, balanced with reasonable battery life (which might be better than i think, considering my well lit pocket)

Pocket clip snapped immediately, but the vendor arranged for a replacement part to be shipped directly to me from Singapore with little hassle.

I use it every day in the dark season, more usable form factor than my H1R(too short) for EDC. Occasionally I find it turned on while clipped in my pocket, a hazard of the tail cap button. Not a deal breaker, I still prefer it to other options, and I have examples of pretty much everything out there. I hardly use the 13E on my keychain anymore.

OLIGHT. Enough said.

1,R3O6PYS6PLLF8H,True,Excellent! Low light setting is very bright. Bright light is VERY bright.,"I was worried when I ordered this that the 5 lumen low-light setting would be too dim to be of any use; that I'd be stuck burning through triple A batteries on the high setting, (which it apparently does, according to the specs, in 20 minutes!). Yikes.

But the low setting, (which offers up to 9 hours of lighting on a single alkaline cell), is entirely sufficient for any basic flashlight task that I'd need it for, such as navigating in a dark room or trying to find stuff at the bottom of a camping backpack in a low light area. Even working at night on a car engine, (as we see advertised in many flashlight ads!), would be quite doable, I am sure, on the low setting with this light.

As for the build quality; it's excellent. I was letting my friend's kids play with it, (just 3 and 4 year old boys), and along with it easily surviving being dropped and bounced around roughly, we also tried it out under water, filling a bowl and tossing it in while lit. (I probably wouldn't have gone to this level of testing if it weren't for the kid's fascination. I told them it was waterproof and this was the coolest thing they'd ever heard. It's easy to impress little kids!). Anyway, the light worked underwater no problem.

The button at the back is quite firm, (almost too much for a 3 year old's fingers to work), so I have no concern that it might accidentally activate while in a pocket or backpack.

Anyway.., while I've not had it for more than a week, and have no proof that it will still be functioning this time next year, I have a very good feeling about it. It doesn't look or feel cheaply made. It has the feel of ""High Quality"". For a $25 flashlight, I'm quite pleased with the purchase.

2,RUGR3ZNKHSX1Z,True,Another winner by Olight,"Another great product from Olight. I like everything about this light - from the functions of the light itself to the spiral grip and pocket clip. Very innovative.

I've seen some negative comments regarding the run-time on high mode, but who wants to use a light like this on high mode all the time? If that's what you want in a light, than this clearly isn't the light for you. Personally, I use it on low mode 95% of the time. When I do use high mode it's only for a few seconds at a time. This isn't some tactical defense flashlight, it's just a penlight, and it does its job wonderfully.

The fact that you can find batteries for it at almost any store or gas station on the planet is a good thing as well.",canada,"December 1, 2018",Graeme,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:14:43.467721,2020-10-27 22:14:43.581384,"Olight I3T EOS 180 Lumens Dual-Output Slim EDC Flashlight with CW LED,60 Meters Tail Switch,Powered by AAA Battery with SKYBEN Battery Case",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07DQKV38W,,"#68,151 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3,R39FB3QVLO19GS,True,Love it!,"I have the regular black coated aluminum version of this light and really like it, so I wanted to try the copper one and see what type of patina it develops.

Thus far I haven't carried it enough to really notice much of a colour change, but I must say I really enjoy the feel and functionality of this light. It's an excellent EDC light with great light output and very nice fit and finish.

The copper version is quite a bit heavier than the aluminum one, and I like that. It has some heft to it. It has the feel of a well made, substantial light. That, plus the cool copper colour, makes for a very aesthetically appealing light.",canada,"December 9, 2018",Graeme,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:14:43.586292,2020-10-27 22:14:43.699027,"Olight I3T EOS 180 Lumens Dual-Output Slim EDC Flashlight with CW LED,60 Meters Tail Switch,Powered by AAA Battery with SKYBEN Battery Case",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07DQKV38W,,"#68,151 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

28,R325CRRQW1A7R0,False,Impressive AAA light.,"This is my first Olight and I found the build quality to be excellent, and this light is their lower end at $26 CAD. The clicky tail is one of the nicest and most satisfying to click that I've experienced as well as having a very nice textured rubber tail button. But the button protrudes out making tail standing impossible. It produces 180 lumens on high, but the light turns on first in low mode at 5 Lumens. It is a simple, two mode light with no special modes. 180 is impressive from a single AAA alkaline battery. Not the brightest AAA light in 2019, but still one of the brightest for the cost. The low 5 lumen mode is bright enough for many tasks but can actually be a bit too bright indoors at closer ranges. The beam is a soft, wide, balanced flood good for medium range. The colour on mine is very neutral. This flashlight is great for finding things in the dark outside. It also comes with a two way clip that allows the light to be clipped on hats or other clothing in either direction.

Pros:
+Runs on one of the most common batteries, (AAA) and basic AAA rechargeables
+It makes a great gift especially since it comes with a battery included and runs on common batteries
+Interesting ""helix"" knurling design that also seems to grip better than standard knurling
+Great quality, and brightness for the price
+Small size and low weight
+Sturdy two-way clip is useful and reliable
+Wide beam make it great for finding things or seeing where you're going

Cons:
-Wide beam doesn't throw as far as a more focused type
-Not designed to use or benefit from higher discharge batteries
-Cannot tail stand

31,R2V2426DVTKPG8,True,Excellent alternative to Microstream,"Let's face it, if you're considering this light, you are also considering the best alternative to it, the Streamlight MIcrostream. The Olight is, for all intents and purposes, the same weight and size, and it too takes a AAA battery. Build quality is comparable as well. The big difference is the power output. If I light them up side by side, the Olight totally overtakes the Streamlight. It's got a throw that won't compare to larger more powerful lights, but considering the size, and class of the I3t, it's is really rather stunning.

I do not ""hard use"" this light, so I can't speak to its durability, as it leads a fairly easy life. I put a lithium AAA battery in it, so that I never have to worry about leakage or loss of power over time, and it sits in my briefcase waiting to be called on for occasional use. When it is time to use it, this thing delivers like crazy. It's an excellent value and pushes way above the price point.

32,RXHMFJT47GKSK,True,Good but not not great,"The build quality is excellent and it feels good in the hand, however I have less expensive flashlights which are smaller and perform equally as good. The beam on this flashlight could be brighter and more focused.

I do like the push button tail cap vs the twist found on many small lights. Another positive of this flashlight is that it does not get hot when left on for an extended period of time.

However if you want something smaller that you can easily put on a keychain or in your pocket then I would consider one of the two flashlights below. I own both and have been very happy with them. They appear to be just as bright even though they have less lumens (possibly because the beam is a bit tighter). They are also less expensive at 9.99. Keep in mind the smaller flashlights will get a little hot if left on for over a minute.

33,R2XB1OTP18KWOB,True,Excellent little flashlight,"OK! I've been reviewing far too many flashlights lately, and this one has quite a few things to recommend it highly. It uses stock AAA batteries (and comes with an alkaline one) meaning you can use your own existing piles of rechargeable AAA batteries. It has a pretty simple and solidly tactile latching press button on the pommel. (I have a nit pick and/or complaint about the 2-mode memory choice later, but physically it is good.) Rugged and useful belt clip is removeable, not welded on or otherwise permanently attached. O-ring inside battery cover for good seal, solid feel, no battery rattle, etc. Both light modes are good, the low is just about right for a quick look in a bedside table, tool or tackle box, without blinding yourself while still giving you the illumination you need, and the high is actually pretty reasonable for a AAA. (Is it 180 lumens? I don't have a measurement, but my gut says it is in the 120-140 range honestly. If you want to illuminate a tree from 100 yards this is not the flashlight for you, anyway.)

Medium-to-high rating for the packaging: Nesting paper/cardboard boxes, the outer is an easy tape cut and tab open, the inner which has a perforated tear strip to get in quickly. Actual paper manual with (minimal) instructions but good diagrams. It gets a ""ding"" for the inclusion of a plastic spacer in the outer box, and for the use of (well designed, but please use paperboard, people!) plastic to hold the flashlight inside the inner box. Now! I will say that the ""spacer"" is actually useful and repurposeable. For one, it can hold the belt clip when detached so you won't lose it. But it's also a nice little box for tiny screws, tiny watch batteries, etc. It doesn't appear recyclable, but maybe a little ""don't throw me away, I'm useful!"" label on it would keep some plastic from our landfills and waterways.

Where it gets a solid ""darn it!"" from me is the memory/control for the light modes. Again, happy with the modes themselves, both the simple number (2) and the light levels overall for each. And it does have a reasonably good feature to prevent ""OH DAMN WHAT IS THAT BRIGHT LIGHT MY EYES"" as that the instructions say (and the product does follow) ""If it is turned on over 2 seconds after it was switch off, it will go directly to low mode as default again"". Just go to the last mode selected, people, and use your good momentary select feature to cycle when I *want* to cycle! how is that hard!) But since this is a MUCH better ""oh darn"" than ""OH DARN THIS LIGHT CAME ON AT 200 LUMENS WHEN I WAS EXPECTED 10"" that some other flashlights burn your retinas with, I'm not dinging this light for that choice too terribly much. 4.5 stars, closer to 5, as this is really a hard feature to get right ""for everyone"" after all, we all have a different preference here based on how we will use the light.

Now, some feature improvement ideas: 1. better memory mode, just use the last mode I had on for more than 2 seconds, instead of resetting to low light mode, and then it's my fault if I overwhelm my night vision. But really that is a hard design choice to make either way while keeping the controls simple. Maybe keep your niche here? 2. Magnetic recharge port integrated into the button (I may or may not have a patent pending design here...) and rechargeable battery inside. 3. No plastic in the packaging please, or at least make it clearer to folks that the outer box spacer is actually useful, ""don't throw me away!"" labeling? 4. Let me unscrew the lens cap so that in the far-future event that the LED finally dies, I can solder on a new/brighter/more efficient one. Yes, I can cut it open and re-weld it after, but ... I don't really want that hassle.

A couple of weeks later, I found myself having to click about half a dozen times until it eventually turned on and cleaning up the screw wasn't making any difference. Now it will only work when I press the button all the way down and hold it there; if I release my finger, it turns off — the clicking mechanism seems to be working fine (it's making the same sound it did when I bought this unit).

I have other flashlights —a Maglite from way before the first Cree LED units started showing up, a 2×AA Fenix I bought over a decade ago, and some cheap supermarket ones that are… ok-ish— and none of them ever had any of the problems I've had with this one.

49,R1A7W8AJ0U8K5I,True,Leave it... get the Microstream,"Leave this one alone.... Get the StreamLight Microstream.
I’ve had this light for about 4 months, previously owned 3 Microstreams.
The two brightness levels of the Olight is a handy feature, and the high beam is brighter than the StreamLight, but Olight burns through the batteries. The main reason is the weak button that is easily depressed in the pocket. The light comes on and stays on until you realize, sometimes hours later. But it still doesn’t seem an efficient light, even if I don’t catch it shining in my pocket... my opinion. The Microstream has a very stiff button, never have I found it on in my pocket.
Both have the reversible clips, which is a great feature.... but don’t let the clip and the promise of more lumens dupe you like it did me.

If they ever make it in copper again I'll order another one for me and make sure the wife doesn't snatch it for one of her other bags!",the united states,"January 4, 2020",SafetyMark,5.0,0,2020-10-27 22:17:20.041836,2020-10-27 22:17:20.179503,"Olight I3T EOS 180 Lumens Dual-Output Slim EDC Flashlight with CW LED,60 Meters Tail Switch,Powered by AAA Battery with SKYBEN Battery Case",4.6,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07DQKV38W,,"#68,151 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
