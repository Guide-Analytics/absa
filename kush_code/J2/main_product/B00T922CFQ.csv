0,R1K9TV4XDFP63L,True,Do not purchase this product or other products from this vendor!,"I purchased this as gift for a law enforcement friend. Upon arrival I tested light plugged into charging cable and it seemed to work fine. Later I was told the light did not work, and sure enough, even though it would charge batteries the light would only work when connected to charging cable. I contacted Nitecore’s warranty claim email and received response in broken English that I should contact. EdisonBright. I sent two emails to Edisonbright copied to Amazon, and although I received an acknowledgment, stating I would receive a response within two days, neither has bothered to reply. When I followed up with nitecore I received another message that I would have to ship the light to China for warranty claim. I couldn’t believe that nitecore didn’t even have USA presence for warranty claim.

Further I was extremely disappointed that neither EdisonBright nor Amazon bothered to even respond to my claim.

If I were you, I would find both another brand and other vendors from which to purchase products.

Sometimes it would work if you held it a certain way, and finally stopped working at all. The batteries were charged and the tiny light on the side that showed battery charge still worked. I wrote the Amazon company (EdisonBright) and they said to send it in to them. (NiteCore told me to contact the Amazon company).

2,R2ADDXT21W7UD9,True,Really disappointed in this light,"I’m reviewing this light after roughly 2.5 years of ownership. First, this light has gotten really limited use for the reasons I’ll mention in this review. It has never been abused and looks brand new. I loved the idea of a rechargeable flashlight and it’s definitely bright, but it simply doesn’t hold a charge between uses. I’d charge it up, use it a bit, put it in my bag, and when I’d grab it out to use again a couple of weeks later, it was dead as a hammer. Charge it up again, and same story. For this reason, it finally ended up in my kitchen as a light for around the house. Problem is, it never got used because it was always dead. Today, I plugged in to charge and it isn’t even charging anymore. I’ll try some CR123a lithium batteries, but that defeats the purpose of getting a rechargeable light in the first place.

One other gripe I have is with the switch design and placement. It’s a small rectangular button on the side. It’s not especially easy to feel in the dark and what’s worse is that the micro USB charging port is in the same location on the opposite side and it has a rubber cover that is almost identical to the power switch. The switch isn’t in an especially intuitive spot on the body of the light either.

Overall, this light was a huge disappointment and a waste of money. I seldom leave one-star reviews, but this light deserves it and I don’t plan to purchase any more products from Nitecore.",the united states,"November 2, 2020",Browncoats Unite!,1.0,0,2020-11-12 15:18:51.979142,2020-11-12 15:18:52.115792,"Nitecore MH10 CREE XM-L2 U2 LED 1000 Lumen USB Rechargeable Flashlight, 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery, USB Charging Cable and Holster with 2 X EdisonBright CR123A Lithium Batteries",4.0,133.08,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00T922CFQ,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GiY5K7EML._AC_SX425_.jpg

5,R2MSK85LQRTIDO,True,"Worked for two years, then dead","When I first got this flashlight, I really liked it. I should've gotten the one with the end-cap button, but oh well. It was really bright and was just what I needed. However, about two years in I started having problems. Now you might say that two years is a respectable amount of time, but for the price, I would expect it to last longer. Besides the fact that it stays on my duty belt, in it's holster most of the time--I probably got only 1-2 hours of run time over that period.

Anyway, I would go to use the flashlight and the battery would be totally dead. No warning, nothing. Just dead. So I'd charge it up again. Then a while later I would go to use it again and again, dead. Long story short, the switch is bad and the flashlight turns on periodically thereby draining the battery. I never noticed it because it stays in my holster most of the time.

Maybe I got a bad one, not sure.

6,R2D6PXK5KUYLT8,True,"Unbelievably bright EDC light. Recharges with a micro USB, or can use regular batteries as well!","This light is one of the brightest EDC lights I've ever seen in my life. The Nitecore lights are very much a baller EDC on a budget brand. Some models might not have all the features as some of the bigger names, but I've never had an issue with reliability with them. This particular light I picked out due to its 22650 rechargeable battery which is included, and the internal ability to charge it. Some other rechargeables I have to charge with an extra charger and that becomes very very difficult to carry around in my EDC bag. I can charge this with the same microUSB cable I charge half of my other electronics with, and easily even charge it in my car.

7,R2YZ8UIBN8LDND,True,Excellent output for it's size,Excellent output for it's size. The lowest setting is plenty for walking on difficult terrain at night and the brightest is excellent for lighting up a large area or as a temporary defensive blinding tool. Very handy if you also keep spare charged batteries for prolonged use/ if you will be out for days. I've used high quality rechargeable flashlights since the early 80's and this is my current favorite. The USB-micro USB charging cord is very handy and many cell phone charging cords you may already have will work too. I like that it turns on to the last brightness setting you were using when it was turned off.

9,RHF0QNSMEZHR9,True,Great Flashlight!,"Awesome flashlight! It is blinding bright at the highest setting, and I love the three modes of strobing, SOS, and emergency. If you are out and every have a problem, one of these three modes will be extremely helpful. The strobe will likely put a person down, or at least contract their pupils and confuse them to the point you can get away. I am using the included 16500 battery. I've used this flashlight quite a bit, and no noticeable dimming, and have not recharged the battery at all. I did try the two cr123 batteries and they did not last as long as I would have hoped. Another cool function is that when you unscrew the cap, then screw it back on, the push button pulses to tell you the voltage of the battery. It also has a built in mini-USB charger for the 16500 battery. The construction is top notch. It will last forever, AND you can use it underwater!

21,R166PJKBXQB7AY,True,Please look at a Striker M1X or a Thrulite TC12,"Please think twice before buying. The on/off has 6 total settling. Last button kept in memory.
Special note; I returned this flashlight yesterday, no questions asked. Great quick service! However
The on/button is on one side the recharger rubber cap is on the, other. Poor choice.
Cannot find on off swith easily.
Push once get 10w power, Puch and hold it cycles 10w, 100w, 500 to 600w, last Puch hold goes to burst. It's a great light. Fiddling Strobe or SOS, 2 quick taps = Strobe hold a few seconds and you fet SOS!
Even after reading the manual this light swith works like a nightmare. Cannot tell what your pushing, rubber cap for a micro mini usb charge port cover feels like on / off switch (you could use another flashlight to look for proper switch)??
It came with a 2300 mAh rechargeable 18650 battery. Charge time is very quick. However the battery will not hold a charge all day much less 24 hours. I had to plug it up in my car on a 400+ mile trip to make sure I could use it at night.
Look at the ThruNite TC12 I just ordered one, I've already got a Striker M1X Great light (I would recommend the Striker M1X EXCEPT you cannot recharge this battery in the flashlight). I sent mine off to have a custom holster made for it. I'm hoping my Thru Lite TN 12 will fit, if not I'll send it out for a good holster.

The holder that came with the this Nitecore MH10 is so poorly made you have to fight with it to get it in the holster. I do use the pocket clip on the visor of my. Hat so I need the pocket clip, it makes it even harder to holster.

25,R2ZHB729UP3YYM,True,Great lights -- I haven't found anything brighter in the ...,"Great lights -- I haven't found anything brighter in the same approximate size or price range.

Downsides: On/off switch location takes some getting used to, and even once you get used to it, it's still a HORRIBLE, somewhat *unsafe* location.

Wearing my light in it's holster, one day I smelled something burning in my car. It got bad enough that I pulled-off the road to shut-down the car & check everything. I eventually discovered that it was the flashlight. Something, perhaps me, perhaps my seatbelt, etc. had tapped the flashlight's switch while it was in the carrying holster, & activated the flashlight in it's highest power setting. The light is so powerful that despite being LED, it generated enough heat to where the nylon carrying holster segment that the flashlight lens rested against started to give off fumes!

While I don't know if it eventually may have caught fire or not, nor do I intend to test the flashlight by leaving the lens up against a piece of paper, I strongly feel that the location of the power switch creates a safety risk. At a bare minimum, the risk is that you'll accidentally have it running in the holster & kill the battery.

The little rubber flap that covers the USB port on the flashlight will eventually break-off, if you handle the flashlight a lot, especially if you have to open/close that flap to re-charge the flashlight a lot. The good news is that most people won't need to be charging it all that often, and if/when the rubber USB port protector breaks off, a little bit of electrical tape will work just fine.

I recommend this flashlight only if you can be very careful of the power switch. But I also hope & *expect* that when Nitecore designs a new version of it, they'll relocate or at least re-design the power switch, for safety reasons. If not, I think they risk a lawsuit.",the united states,"June 25, 2016",T Tyler,4.0,0,2020-11-12 15:19:04.739638,2020-11-12 15:19:04.895153,"Nitecore MH10 CREE XM-L2 U2 LED 1000 Lumen USB Rechargeable Flashlight, 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery, USB Charging Cable and Holster with 2 X EdisonBright CR123A Lithium Batteries",4.0,133.08,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00T922CFQ,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GiY5K7EML._AC_SX425_.jpg

29,R20GBKYF6WHI70,True,Byer beware!,This flashlight is amazing! With four brightness settings it's like four flashlights in one small package. Then with the really bright strobe setting it becomes a defensive weapon. To call it a flashlight is an understatement. I really like the ease of changing it as it charges directly from my iPad and iPhone charger bank. We bought two. After 3 months of ownership I decided to try running one of the flashlights on the cr123 batteries. Big mistake! After only 30 seconds of use on the cr123's it seemed like the switch burned out. The MH10 would not light not even after replacing the cr123's with the 18650. Seeing the 5 year warranty promise on the box I figured all I have to do is send it back to EdisonBright and they will send me a new one. They sent me an RMA number and I sent it back with my address enclosed and I have not yet been sent a new one. I find no phone number to call them on their website. The MH10 cost $65 and that is a lot of money to spend and to have NOTHING to show for it!,the united states,"November 13, 2016",A. J.

30,R3A41C830D5MLN,True,A Great Light!,"I love this light and it is everything I was looking for and expected in a hand held, carry with me everyday light. It has a nice feel in the hand and is easy to carry in the pocket or bag (e.g.: computer bag). The only negative/unexpected thing I noticed about it is, by feel without looking, it is hard to tell the difference between the control button and the USB port cover. Both are placed in similar places on the body of the light and have similar feels. This could be an issue in the dark under stress. I solved the problem by putting the pocket clip on the light so that it ""points"" to the control switch. The only light I might consider in its place is the Nitecore MH-20 which is a bit shorter, has 5 rather than only 4 brightness levels, includes a built in strike bezel, and the switch appears to be enough different from the USB port cover as to not be confusing in feel. On the other hand, the MH-10 is marginally more focused and has a longer throw (Beam Intensity & Beam Distance; according to published specs) which is what attracted me to it.",the united states,"August 30, 2015",Danny S.

31,RHXIJ0M580P53,True,Very good light with a few caveats,"Nice light pretty powerful, only issue is the button placement.

Its light and the battery life if decent. This light desperately needs a tail cap button however and the holder is junk. 4 stars if holder was better or price was better, 5 if it had a tail cap button.

WARNING - these batteries are NOTORIOUS for dying quickly so pick yourself up a second. Do not get it on the EBAY special - right now battery ""fraud"" is insane. If you get a cheap battery be prepared to replace it in less than a week.

Pick up a Nitecore charger with display so you can see when your batteries are starting to go bad. When purchasing a new one grab a Panasonic or other recognized brand from a recognized dealer.

60,R262FTPZ2IMNKI,True,Solid flashlight for duty use,"I'm very impressed with this flashlight. It's got a solidly constructed body and rubberized buttons and a rubber cover for the charging port (which takes standard USB plugs. Probably the same one you have for your phone if you have an Android smartphone). Controls are simple; there's only one button and its on/off or push and hold to cycle through the brightness levels. The belt case is a full enclosure with a Velcro strap that holds out in securely. In addition to the rechargeable battery, there were also two disposable batteries you could carry for backup.

The only downside so far is that the control button and the USB port cover are around the same size and feel and are located opposite each other on the case. It makes them indistinguishable to the touch and you'll try and press the charging port cover sometimes. It's a fairly minor annoyance.",the united states,"January 5, 2016",Barry D.
