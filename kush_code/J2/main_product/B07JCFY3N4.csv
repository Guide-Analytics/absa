3,R3HMMN7KP7ZJ0K,True,Solid,"Had a chance to use this for a few weeks...

Pros: insanely bright, great size, built solid, good battery life and generally easy to use. Fantastic value at this price point. Comes with accessories and replacement pieces for years of use. Feels well made. Throws an awesome, wide beam. I went with the CW and have zero regrets.

Cons: Easy to accidentally turn on based on the location of the power button, difficult to locate the power button in the dark - doesn’t have much feel, the unit will run hot if you have it on high...will feel even warmer on turbo, the click/hold mechanism to adjust between settings can be finicky.

I was especially interested in the impact and water resistant features as well as levels of brightness. Initially the flash light wouldn't turn on after a few uses.

It worked wonderfully for a couple of weeks of very little use, however then all of a sudden it quit working.

8,R14NTR07WLWM73,True,"Super light, rugged, bright, all around solid, worth the price!","Great first impressions. I haven't consciously tested the battery life but it doesn't need to be charged after every camping trip (though it's a good idea to get it to full charge for each trip). The flashlight is so lightweight yet is solidly built. I tried it in water (briefly) and when I opened it up it was dry. They give you extra o rings and also 2 extra rubbers to replace the one covering the charger, great idea! The belt hook is super solid for how light it is. The strap is solid, it was hard to get on. I used a piece of thread to pull the cord of the strap through. Each setting is nice, while the brightest setting is great I think the lowest setting is underrated, it's perfect for searching in a tent and uses virtually no battery life. The battery life indicator is nice too. Also, you could buy a spare battery from them and change it out like a AA (note this will NOT also take a AA batteries like some of their other models).

Although I’ve only had it for a few days I simply can’t believe the amount of light this thing throws for it’s size (and not even on Turbo). Doing a side by side comparison with MAG LED was no comparison... I mean not even close (and I originally thought the mag was bright 😳)

As far as build quality, in my opinion the TC15 is fantastic. Has a nice weight (not to light, but not heavy)... the fit and finish is fantastic and fits nicely in my pocket.

I did a lot of research when before purchasing, and I know there were some reviews of the lights not working upon arrival, however mine worked perfectly- just gave the top and bottom a quick tighten and off I went. I’m really happy I went with the Thrunite.

14,R24SONZWTXSUHG,True,Great tool.,"First of all, I wish to say that this flashlight is a perfect EDC carry for most general use situations. For those who complained about battery life, durability and charging issues, it could be a defect but most likely it is a small issue which can be corrected by the user.

1. Battery life - I’ve been using the same battery charge for over a week and I use this thing a lot. Some folks note that the battery dies very quickly. I suggest using the low power settings as often as possible. The turbo mode isn’t meant for long use; it is for a quick look Into a large area. Strobe is for survival and tactical use. These two settings make the unit get very warm and can possibly wreck some internal components of used for long periods of time which may be why some others users complained about the flashlight dying after a month.
2. Brightness - 2300 lumens. If that doesn’t tell you what you need to know, sorry about your luck. Jokes aside, it’s very bright. At least as bright as those super bright halogens you see coming at you in the dead of night on the highway. Do not look into the lens. You have been warned.
3. Durability - Be reminded that this is a flashlight made up mostly of light metal, glass and plastic. Yes it will probably survive a small drop but remember, it is still a light duty tool. Don’t go using it to adjust whatever it was you crawled under the stairs to fix. There is a slight moment of disconnection when you strike the end of the light on a surface, even very lightly.

Some users complained about the unit not taking a charge. I prefer to pull the battery out and charge it with an external charger, but for those who do not own one or prefer to use the USB charge function, I will speak from experience by saying that I had similar issues when I first opened my package. Fixing this issue was as simple as making sure that both the end cap AND the battery sleeve are tight otherwise you won’t have proper contact and the light will not operate.
4. Usability - The multi function and brightness levels are fantastic. Personally I mainly use firefly mode and low mode. But cycling through the settings is very easy. I saw complaints about the switch being hard to find as it blends into the design of the light. I suggest turning the pocket clip to point at the switch to make it much easier to locate in the dark.

For the occasional user, just a bit of free advice. Batteries don’t like to be left sitting in an unused contact position for long periods of time. If you plan to put this away until next camping season, I suggest removing the battery from the sleeve.

In closing, finally, (apologies to those of you who read this whole thing) I’ll say that this is well worth the buy. It functions exactly as advertised and I’m very happy with my purchase.",canada,"June 29, 2020",Marty McFly,5.0,10,2020-10-28 00:40:06.391519,2020-10-28 00:40:06.505665,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

15,R2CBVO5D6SL4XR,True,"Excellent value for dollar, probably brightest for size and cost",I've owned many LED flashlights and this one is amazingly bright for it's size. On Turbo it's a monster for it's size. It's too bad they don't sell a tail-clickie version of this light. My previous EDC was a Thrunite Newton 2c which was nice with it's variable brightness but only 1/2 as bright. Thrunite's also nice in that they come with a Warm-White LED instead of being stuck with Blue-White. It comes with a special high current IMR Lithium rechargable for the incredible power it draws.

16,RLUMU7HZSWOP4,True,Another great light from Thrunite.,"Flashlight is very bright in turbo mode but heats up really fast. (To the point of being too hot to hold)
So turbo is only good for very short periods.
All other light modes are good.
I own several Thrunite flashlights and this one is built to the same high quality.
I only gave I three stars for durability because I’m uncertain whether the overheating in turbo might affect overall durability.

17,R253KDCV1NJQ4K,True,"Thrunite TC15 - Superb light throw, superb durability. Needs a couple improvements. Would buy again.","Purchased 2 TC15 NWs.
Pros:
Great flashlight. Superb light throw, superb durability. Needs a couple design improvements. Would buy again. Fits well in pant pocket alongside wallet. Holster is good as well. I chose Neutral White as colors remain accurate. CW and NW throw the same brightness level, CW casts a blue hue though which did not appeal to me.

Cons:
The light button is hard to find as it is on a smooth face. You will be thumb dragging across the surface searching for it. The button is opposite the USB rubber cover port, you can use that as a guide. Thrunite gives you a rubber 'nipple' tactile button switch addon, although they do not include any instructions on how to install it and it appears you need a special tool to replace the button.

I do find the flashlight a little slippery to hold, even with the ""Grippy and non-slip knurling"". If your fingers/thumb have even minimal moisture or sweat they will easily slide over this 'non slip knurling'. I keep the lanyard on all the time for this reason.

A reverible clip would be a better feature as well.",canada,"October 19, 2020",Westcoastsurf,4.0,0,2020-10-28 00:40:06.759356,2020-10-28 00:40:06.869650,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

19,R1TTRUGKU1ASB9,True,EXCELLENT FOR SELF DEFENSE!!,"Bought this for my wife for self defense when she walks to her car at night. Perfect size to keep in her hand as she walks to her car. There is a lanyard to keep the light attached to her wrist. The light has a memory, so set the light to the setting you most often use and then leave it. However, where this light really shines (lol) is when you need it for self defense. All you need to do is press the side button twice quickly. This brings the light to turbo mode (ie. very bright). This bright light can be directed at the person or animal to identify the threat. If the threat becomes more aggressive, just click the button another two times quickly and you will get a blinding strobe light which can be directed at the eyes of the threat. The light is blinding so be careful not to shine in anyone's eyes unless they are a threat to your safety.

Bad things, it's hard to find the switch to turn it off and on, but that can be modified, and using the highest brightness will get pretty hot in certain ambient temptures. Outside during a cold day, probably stay cool enough to hold till it it auto dims, after 2 min. Hot days or holding it too tight will cook your hand, it's surprisingly hot.

Good size, comfortable to hold.

Good beam distance/angle.
Water proof. I don't think I'll use it under water, but being able to wash dirt off is nice.

Cons:
Button can be hard to locate in the dark/by feel.
I would have liked it to have some sort of rubber sleeve or something to dampen the impact if I drop it.

36,R2IJ2A0MLWCL88,True,Professional quality light,I work in the field quite a bit and flashlights are an important piece of safety gear. I have bought some of the cheaper high powered lights on amazon before and they are fairly bright but lack quality and will fail on you at the worst time down the road. This light is much brighter than anything I have ever used. I am able to see 500m+ into dark open fields. There are many different settings on this light that can be switched between using a solid side button which I like. The other models with the rubber push button back have always failed on me after time. It does require you to read the manual to learn how to activate all the settings. overall this seems like fairly solid construction and am defiantly happy with it for the price.

38,R386C12MIR62YW,True,Bang for your buck! Great tactical light.,"This is a small tactical light with a big output. You can easily see ahead within 200m of darkness. The hot zone projects better than I expected, and the flood provides more than efficient lighting to see the surrounding area. Using turbo within 10m is not needed even to find the smallest detail, the high setting is more than efficient to view anything within 80-100 m. Obviously if you want to see something in detail from afar, your best bet is to go closer. The lumens are extremely powerful and the flashlight performs very well for its size. I love the memory setting on the light. Aside from the actual flashlight, the holder is the downfall for me. I wish it came with horizontal straps to allow me to attach it on my molly vest, but that is just me nitpicking.

46,R16LIZLOJFCOIZ,True,Had to sand down housing to create a good circuit. Battery is high capacity.,High light setting is hot with your hand placed in front of the light. (very bright). The light needs to be done up super tight every time you remove the battery. Also some factory grease will need to be wiped off and the housing needs to be sanded down on both ends to make a good connection. This is a basic quality control issue.

Feels robust, belt clip is nice and tight so should have no problem staying on my pocket or belt. Really like the user interface, strobe isn't the first function every time (like another flashlight I had that I returned at another store). Saves the last used function (low, medium, high). Turbo and strobe are double clicks. I like firefly mode for when you need to be more discreet. Definitely bright, even on high, never mind turbo.

I'm not running the light for hours at a time on any brightness, usually 15 - 20 minutes on medium and maybe a minute or two on turbo. I don't really use the high setting, as turbo is more convenient by double clicking. It's nice that the battery is removable, as when I take it camping, I bring a spare battery so I can have one battery charging while the other is in use.

189,R1PTOEVT82HPEA,False,Bright and Solid,"I have finally received my TC-15 after a long 2 months wait. I ordered straight from the thrunite site because i wanted the custom model from ""the outsider"".

After waiting for 2 weeks with no news I sent an email and got a reply that the ""outsider"" model was back ordered and was going to be another 25 to 50 days before it was shipped. I got offered a refund but I opted to wait and it was worth it,  despite my frustration to not have it for my upcoming fall camping trip.

The color is really beautiful and the built quality is top notch. It performs outstandingly well in cold and wet weather as well as being really solid. I'm not afraid to drop it or have it bang around a bit while hanging from it's lanyard around my hand when I need both of them and it feels like it will last forever.

I am really pleased with it and you can see it in action on ""the outsider"" you tube channel if you wish. I can't wait to have the mini unit that goes around the keychain as it will be super useful.

however a few things I would liked to have on this flashlight would be a tail cap switch since it feels more familiar too me using a tail cap button. And I'm a bit worried about how well the glass on the flashlight is going to handle an impact since the glass seems rather thin.

But overall I'm still really glad and impressed by the power behind the thrunite TC15. It definitely helped me be more comfortable in the woods by lighting up everything in my surroundings and I can definitely see this scaring off any potential unwanted visitors in the camp.

197,RKMAJ3DUQAUIH,True,Brightest for the size,"I have another 11000 lumens Thrunite flashlight and these are amazing products. It's the best performance you can get at this price point. As an avid collector of LED flashlights, you cannot get 2300 lumens at this size without some serious thought by the compamy. This light uses the most current series CREE bulb the ""XHP"". Most other companies still use XPL bulbs which aren't as efficient or as bright. Bigger known brands with ""blue"" tips is almost double the price, but they limit it to 1500 lumens.

I like how thrunite let's you run the bulbs to their maximim capability for the times you really need the extra light and not baby you by not having it available. The light does get very hot if you run the highest turbo setting so you can't do that for very long. It's very stable at medium and it gets warm at high setting but it's worth the tradeoff for being so small. The built in charger is a nice touch for anyone who's just a casual user of high power flashlights. Perfect for gifts!

One thing to note, if you receive yours and it doesn't turn on, make sure to tighten the shaft body to the led head as well as the tail cap. Took me awhile to figure out that there are two twistable areas.",canada,"June 8, 2019",Optiblue,5.0,20,2020-10-28 00:41:36.962370,2020-10-28 00:41:37.104761,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

202,R35HKLO6CBGARD,True,"Excellent mix of quality, performance and price.","This is probably my 10th Thrunite light. I find that Thrunite strikes a good balance between quality, performance and price. The TC15 is no exception.

I highly recommend this light, but there are a few things to look at before you buy. I’ll start with the positives, and then a few possible negatives to consider before you buy.

Positives:

Brightness and levels: This light is bright! Up to 2300 lumens is going to be more than most people will ever need for all but the most unusual of situations. 99.9% of regular everyday situations will be covered with this light, and its various levels, in my opinion. I like the spacing of the brightness levels. At first I was concerned about the difference between medium at 250 and high at 1050, and thought 500 in between would be useful. However, in practice I found it to be just fine. The levels are 1, 25, 250, 1050 and 2300 lumens plus strobe.

User Interface: with the side electronic switch it’s very easy to access several levels at will. From the off position you can access firefly, last level used and turbo. This is extremely important to me, and very useful. Firefly is accessed by a long press, Turbo by a double click and last mode used is accessed by a single click. Strobe is accessed by a double click from Turbo. High, medium and low can be cycled through by a long press when on. Many lights don’t have this ease of functionality. I usually keep the light on medium so I can have quick access to three useful levels of light for whatever situation I’m in. I find strobe largely useless, and I like that it’s unlikely to accidentally access it.

Teachability and ease of use for “non-flashlight” people: an often overlooked feature with these newer “high-tech” flashlights is the ease of use and being able to teach someone, like other family members, how to access the different modes. I’ve had several lights where the UI was unnecessarily complicated, and often times strobe or some unwanted mode was accessed by accident. Some lights were even difficult to turn on or off intuitively! The TC15 is very easy to use and easy to teach others how to use. Most people are not familiar with high-tech flashlights and just want a light they can turn on and off. They don’t want to think about what they have to do. The UI is easy enough for those people to use.

Built in charger and battery level indicator: A built-in charger is extremely useful when traveling. There’s no need to carry an extra charger. It also eliminates the need to buy a separate charger. There is also a battery level indicator that can warn you when your battery is getting low. Also, very useful.

Build quality: The TC15 feels solid in the hand. There’s no battery rattle. The threads are nice and smooth. The knurling is nice and grippy without feeling aggressive to the touch. There are no blemishes or defects cosmetically of any kind. It’s a very nice looking flashlight.

Size: The TC15 is very compact. It’s the smallest AND brightest 18650 light I have. I have had single AA lights that were nearly the same size. It’s pretty remarkable that it’s this small and has a built in charger! While it’s a tad bulky for an every day carry in a front pant pocket, it is doable. However, it’s very compact for a jacket pocket, cargo pants pocket or keeping in a purse, etc. It also comes with a pocket clip, holster and lanyard to increase portability options.

Price: at $49.99-$59.99, a light of this build quality, performance, and with an 18650 included is pretty much unheard of. You will see other cheaper lights that have specs that appear better, but 99% of the time it’s marketing bs and they don’t come close. The TC15 is the real deal at a great price.

Possible negatives:

I say possible negatives because none of these things are deal breakers for me, but they are something to consider.

18650 battery: 18650 batteries are not common. If you need a replacement in an emergency situation it will almost be impossible to find quickly. So, in the case of prolonged use or during a power outage, you will likely need to have additional 18650’s on hand. It appears that this light cannot take two CR123’s as an alternative, so you’re stuck with 18650’s only. It’s also worth noting these batteries need a little more care compared to normal AA, AAA, C and D cells that people are used to using. If you’ve never used li-ion rechargeables before, read up on them first.

Smooth switch: I find the smooth electronic switch difficult to locate by touch. Which means that I can’t always turn on the light quickly when needed. I find I’m fumbling around to find the switch. There is a rubber switch cap accessory included, but I haven’t been able to unscrew the switch to replace the smooth flat metal switch. It seems that it needs a special tool to loosen it. I tried to unscrew it using an awl and wound up scratching the light.

Easy to accidentally activate the switch: a drawback to these electronic switches is that they can be easily activated accidentally. It doesn’t take much to turn the light on by another object in a pocket or bag. This can result in the battery being unknowingly depleted. The good thing about the TC15 is that it can easily be locked out with a quarter turn of the head to prevent this. However, you have to remember to turn the head each time you put it away or want to reactivate it. If someone is not familiar with this type of lock out, they may think the light is broken or battery dead when they try to use it. It has happened with other lights in the past, and I had to show the person how to unlock it. On the flip side, this is better than some other lock out methods that are not as easy to activate or deactivate.

USB cover tab: this is a bit of a nitpick, but there’s a little pull tab on the usb cover that I find a bit annoying. I notice it all the time when I’m holding the light. I sometimes think something is stuck to it and try to wipe it off. My finger seems to catch on it all the time. I cut the tab off and now it’s perfect. I would have preferred they had something more like the TC20 cover.

Conclusion:

I really like this light. It’s compact and bright! What I perceive as possible negatives are really more about preference than about something wrong with the light. I think they are things to be aware of, but for most people shouldn’t be a deal breaker. I don’t think you can go wrong with this light.

If any additional things come up as I use this light, I’ll be sure to update the review.",the united states,"November 10, 2018",Beck,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:43.748493,2020-10-28 00:41:43.867178,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

203,R1U03932ENXH46,True,DOA but I fixed it...POOR QUALITY/RETURNED,"I was super excited to get this light because my old olight S20 was only 500 lumens. I took out the white plastic in front of the positive battery terminal. I had to use a meat thermometer because it felt like it was glued in there. I reinstall the battery and tightened up the tail cap but the light wouldn't come on. I tried charging it and got the purple flashing in the switch. With it plugged in the light would come on in the low mode so I knew the LED was OK. I was able to unscrew the head of the light and see the LED and all the wiring looked good. The problem is where the tube meets The TC15 label is not Making contact. Grab the light with both hands and unthread this area and then crank it back down. It worked like a charm after this. The other issue is the LED was not centered. If you unscrew the head and loosen the two Phillips screws then take a butter knife and center the chip while tightening the screws. Problems solved! I would say thrunite needs to really work on quality control and have a couple people test The lights before they ship them out. It is a really bright flashlight and does get pretty warm on the turbo but I don't plan on using turbo that often. The strobe is blinding and could easily be used in self-defense. I was seeing spots after a couple seconds. I just got the light today and if I have any other issues I'll be sure to update this review. Now it's time to make a kydex sheath for it

UPDATE....
As Much as I wanted to love this light it was nothing but problems from day one. 3 weeks later and the switch failed and I couldn’t get the light to turn off or even switch modes. I unscrewed the tailcap and every time I would tighten it the light would come on in low mode. I thought the switch felt funny from the beginning and I think thrunite is garbage.

204,RKG2PXU1UBRGX,True,Great flashlight for the price. Highly liked.,"So, I live in the country on some acreage with woods. I wanted this for both work (Corrections) as well as at home use. I wanted a flashlight that would allow me to see a couple hundred feet with ease. I previously had a $80 Fenix light that got lost somewhere. Needed something to replace it but cheaper. So far, this is fantastic. I included some pictures for reference. The tree branches are approx 10 feet away. The woods is probably 100-150 depending on depth. This light is great for the price.

205,R2WAO0ZN0KOOQP,True,Closest thing I've found to the perfect flashlight.,"I've always had a thing for bright flashlights, but most importantly flashlights that are reliable and just work when you need them to.

Firstly, the brightness is truly awe inspiring and makes all my other flashlights look dull. I have the ""neutral white"" version because I can't stand how the blue LEDs tend to wash out colors. When I'm out looking for reptiles this helps keep the truer colors for photography instead of blending them all together.

I also love the fact that it doesn't just cycle modes like every other stupid flashlight that makes you press the button 5 times to get to the mode you want. Instead this one remembers the last brightness used when it's turned on or off, so it always does what you want it to when you press the button.

It's also tiny, which makes the brightness all the more incredible, even if it does get a bit hot on the higher settings. If I had to complain about anything I'd say that I wish it had USB C rather than micro USB, though I'm sure that probably keeps the price down.

Overall I'm very impressed with the quality for the price, though I've only had it for a few days so I will be updating if anything comes up. (Not that I expect it.)

Would recommend, and will be showing it off.",the united states,"January 14, 2020",Jackson G.,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:44.152130,2020-10-28 00:41:44.272732,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

207,R1NEW0XG7GSHA6,True,Great light - thought it was DOA at first,"Originally the light appeared to be DOA but it was not. My son was excited to see the lite brighness. The white battery cover that it ships with was on the inside of the flashlight rather than on the tail piece end. I fished it out and put in the battery and no light. I tested the batteries voltage and it was fine. I hooked the light up to a USB plug to charge and it only shows a flashing purple light but the light would turn on a couple of the low brightness levels. It appeared to be DOA. I kept troubleshooting and figured something was not allowing the battery to make contact. I realized that there is a threaded part just below the switch and ThruNite logo. I tightened up those threads (which I only slightly turned like one millimeter) and the light then worked fine. I think this is the issue that's causing some customers to think the light is DOA... a combo of the white battery cover and the slightly loose threads.

It has a great on/off switch/UI, it's actually kind of addictive to use. It's a small light given how many lumens it can output. It has a switch that has memory from what setting you last used it on. It also allows you to get to the lowest or the highest setting directly from the off position but then still retains the memory of the last brightness. It's nice and a good price.",the united states,"January 22, 2019",Sam,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:44.403444,2020-10-28 00:41:44.558958,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

211,R1VHW4LTXIUX8S,True,Thrunite with lumens or Thrunite are lemons!!,I ordered this flashlight by recommendation. on arrival the flashlight didn't work. I thought maybe the battery was dead but it was not I was able to put it in another flashlight I bought off of amazon and it worked just fine (XML-T6 a cheapo flashlight) I read the manual and checked youtube. youtube videos said there is a little disc on the back of the battery. there was not on one on my thrunite. then I looked inside the flashlight and at the bottom I seen the disc. i tried to get it out precision tweezers and it took a couple tries but I got it. i was excited and the flashlight still didn't work. I tried to plug it in and got a flashing purple light. I informed amazon to get a replacement flashlight. and they shipped one out right away... THE REPLACEMENT DIDN'T WORK EITHER!!!! i had the exact same problem all I get is a purple blinking light. I need to send them both back now :( what are the odds of two DOA lights. What a huge Inconvenience. To make it worse It says I have to drop it off in two days.. or i get billed a second $49.99 well I put the request for a replacement in for the Thrunite Saturday night.

212,R3NCBTU5R5UKWP,True,Good light for a good price.,"This light falls into the class of lights that take a single 18650 battery or two CR123 batteries. It's about 1"" in diameter and 5"" long. It fits into your pocket, but it's maybe a little big to EDC in your pocket. There is a holster included so you can carry this light on your belt. A wrist strap is also included, and it seems to be decent quality, but I won't use the holster or the wrist strap. Also included are a battery and a USB charging cord.

There is a pocket clip that works well. The clip is not a deep carry clip, the back of the flashlight will stick out of your pocket by about 1/2 inch.

The side switch works well, especially in comparison to other lights with this many modes. (For a really bad example, Nightcore makes a flashlight that requires the use of both the tail switch and side switch to access all the modes) When using this light ""regularly,"" you can access low, medium, and high- you change modes by holding the switch while the light is on. The light remembers its last used level when turning on, so it's not like those annoying hotel TVs that always turn on to channel 3. By double clicking the switch you can get to turbo mode, which honestly isn't that much brighter than the normal high mode. Double clicking again gets you to strobe mode. When the light is off, you can press and hold to get to moonlight mode. This seems like a good way to have a lot of modes, but keeping the less commonly used modes from getting in the way of normal use.

Finally, let's talk about light output. Does it actually deliver the claimed zillion lumens? Probably not. Probably none of the lights in this class truly deliver more than 500 lumens. I can't measure lumens, but I can measure lux and convert lux to candelas. The spec sheet claim that max output is 52,000 candelas. I measured the brightest part of the spot at 1660 lux from 9 feet away in a dark room. That was with a fully charged battery and a room temperature flashlight. The 1660 lux I measured at 9 feet translates to 12,000 candelas. So this light doesn't actually meet the claimed specs for candelas, and it probably doesn't meet the claimed specs for lumens either. Not to mention that the Cree datasheets don't claim that their LEDs can output the claimed lumens. Just about every manufacturer that claims an 18650 class light can output over 1,000 lumens is not going to meet that claim. Probably the only honest manufacturer on Amazon is Anker, who only claims 400 lumens for their lights of this size.

The light for does get warm if you leave it on, and can get uncomfortably warm after 30 minutes on high. This is common for these lights. There is circuitry to protect the light from overheating, and you won't burn yourself, but you will not want to hold it if you leave it on high for a long time.

Considering the whole picture, you're getting a pretty complete kit and a good light. It compares favorably against other lights that either don't include a battery, or skimp on a lower spec LED. You've got everything you need in the box. The light doesn't meet the absurd claimed 2300 lumens, but none of these lights do. This is a pretty good compromise between the expensive Surefire lights and the bargain basement lights that cut corners.",the united states,"November 14, 2018",cleverusername,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:51.227701,2020-10-28 00:41:51.348721,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

213,R3GU4JUUNDIMM3,True,Flagship price without the flagship features and build.,"The good: Thrunite is the only light I have that gives you an alternate way to start directly to firefly mode by holding the button down for 1 sec while off. That's a great feature when you don't want to light up the room at night on high, where you left it, then turn it down low after ruining your night visual acuity. The bad: Super turbo 2400lm is sort of pointless. pressing twice quickly puts you in this 2400lumen spec'ed output, but it can not sustain that due to thermals (it gets HOT!). Also, it does not work with normal protected cells due to the huge power drain on the battery tripping the overcurrent shutdown. You need a high output INR with a button top for that mode to work. If you hit it accidentally without such battery installed, the light flashes briefly then shuts down and remembers that shutdown state. You must then remove the lower power battery and install an INR cell to get out of that mode before you can use any other mode (that's just dumb). It locks the flashlight with a non-INR battery even though 4 of 5 modes would still work had it not been locked out! Most good INRs (e.g. Samsung) lack the protection board (you don't need it - this light will shut down before draining the battery all by itself way before the protection board would kick in). A short INR 18650 rattles in the tube because the tiny spring is not long enough to keep it in compression without the button top and protection PCB adding 7mm to the overall length. It will work, but the downside is the light will flicker if it shakes.

That super high power mode is also a specsmanship gimmick because the light quickly thermal throttles down to about the same output of any other single 18650 cell, roughly 1200lm, in a matter of 1-10 seconds while making the tube way too hot to hold. It's only 2400lm for a brief instant when turned on!

Finally, the beam pattern has some weird color shifts in it - the central spot is about right for color temp as ordered (warm) - but around the center spot is even warmer yet, and beyond that it turns purple up to the edge of the beam. None of my other CREE lights do that. Last, as a usability issue, the low profile switch is hard to find in the dark by feel.

216,R21FCJG63YZIQ6,True,Overall great but one little thing.,"To start i have carried tge tc12 for 3-4 years edc and loved, and was ready to find a replacement to give my dad the old one, so i bought this tc15, overall very similar, brighter on boost and a little shorter, maybe lighter on weight im not 100% sure but feels better in pocket with the clip being closer to end of the light. I have only had this for a few weeks and the only thing i could complain about is going from tc12 to the 15 is not haveing the end cap button. I feel this would make this light great for edc, as i feel the side only button is to easy to hit and turn on in pocket or truck door. A different tail cap should be a option to buy or is included. I will try to see if my old tail cap off the tc12 will work. I would give this light 5 stars if it wasnt for the side button only. But i do love this light and would recomend it as well as the tc12, but the 15 sure does have a lumen upgrade over the 12 and is a great upgrade",the united states,"November 13, 2018",Tyler Davis,4.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:51.762310,2020-10-28 00:41:51.879960,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

217,RFIEHCE7A9C1Z,True,Bright little light!,"I really like this light for the size. It really packs a punch considering it's size. The light itself has a smooth "" thrower "" reflector in it, so for it's size, it will really reach out. The battery is a Samsung INR18650. I peeled the "" Thrunite "" cover off of the battery and found that out. I am not a fan of the power button. If it's dark and you have gloves on, it can be tricky to locate ( I am just use to my Zebralight power button being so easy to find ). I am a big fan of how bright it is. I am also a fan of being able to re-charge this on the fly. Sturdy little light.

Another issue I have with it is that it is advertised at 2300 lumens. I have seen tests online people have done that do confirm that it is actually brighter than 2300 lumens, which is fantastic. The problem is, it will only stay at 2300 for a minute or two. There are two things that determine this. 1 - thermal protection. 2 - battery output. I guess this is just being a nit-picky at this point. Because you can't expect something this small, to stay THAT bright for any amount of time because of the battery drain and the heat dissipation, so I get that. But, for the size, it is bright.

I will test it over time and keep my review updated!",the united states,"December 3, 2018",Jeremy,4.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:51.884947,2020-10-28 00:41:52.010594,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

218,R1SU1NPHBPKTDK,True,STAY AWAY !!!,"The only thing worse than this flashlight is the companies HORRIBLE Customer Service. We received the flashlight and fully read the enclosed instructions. The battery was completely dead so we charged it overnight. The light is no where near the listed output of 2300 Lumens. In all honesty it is closer to 200 lumens. My Husband bought a 2 cell AA flashlight at North 40 for $12 that is twice as bright. After emailing the seller we received a return email telling us to screw down the head and tail caps prior to charging. YES we did that, the problem is not that people are too stupid to read the enclosed instructions; the problem is they have completely misrepresented their product. In good conscience I cannot recommend this product or this company to anyone.
UPDATE !!! After posting our review someone from ThruNite contacted us again and asked us to pay to return the light and once they received and inspected it they would offer to fix the light or give us a refund. We did a lot of research before purchasing this light. Imagine our disappointment when we received the light and it does not work as advertised. I understand things happen, in fact I get so angry with reviews that slam a product or seller simply because something went wrong without giving them a fair chance to make it right. That is NOT the case here. We spen hard earned money for a product that simply did not perform as advertised.

219,R3O2UKBJX3BN9B,True,If it wont turn on and theres no battery spacer pull the battery look up by the head of the light,Had a Thrunight light a couple years ago that failed after 3 months. They wouldn't honor the warranty claiming it was dropped. It wasn't. I took 6 close up pics before shipping it back to show no marks. Held a grudge but figure I'd give them another try. Preparedminds101 liked it and I agree. However I was minutes from returning it as defective. Went to remove the spacer between the battery and tailcap but it wasn't there. Light wouldn't turn on. Tried 2 more fresh batteries and still no luck. Getting ready to pack it up and for some reason I shined my other light into it. Someone put the spacer on top of the battery sticking it to the top spring. After fishing it out it works like the reviewers said.

221,R31ZWACKXW7T6H,True,Several shortcomings make it a deal breaker,"For context, I have owned this light for almost 3 months now and have used it daily at work. I would like to start this review by saying I had very high expectations for this flashlight. First and most importantly because of the pricing. This is not a cheap flashlight so I expect it to go above and beyond my expectations. Secondly I have been a big fan of ThruNite's other flashlights. This is my 3rd light from them and they have always been well built and worked great for me. I feel this light fell short in a few areas however.

First the positives. This light is very bright and has an excellent spread of different light outputs. The built in charger is very handy as it makes charging the battery easy to do. The battery life has been good, no issues there. The build quality feels good. It feels rugged like it will take a beating and keep working. The way the light cycles through modes is nice. I like how you don't have to cycle through a strobe mode to get to the different brightness modes. That was a big selling point for me on this particular light.

Now come the big drawbacks of this light. The power button sucks, plain and simple. It is very hard to find by feel. It has no texture difference or any way to find it quickly in the dark, when you are actually using the light. I have given this light to several co-workers and they have quite a bit of trouble figuring out where to push to get the light to come on. If the button was either on the tail or had a rubberized coating on the side it would help greatly with being able to quickly find the button. The power button is also very easy to accidentally turn on in you pocket as it is on the side of the light. Many times I will feel my pocket getting hot and realize the light has been on for who knows how long. I have been having issues from the day I got the light with it not wanting to come on. If it isn't one hundred percent fully tightened it will not come on. When I first got it, as many people have said, you have to take it apart and clean the threads to even get it to work. I feel for this price point that is unacceptable. I also notice when I bump the light when it is on it will sometimes flicker off and on rapidly. Even though it feels as if it fully tightened. I feel the design of the electrical path is sub par in some way and makes it very finicky to even slight changes.

To wrap up this review, I was really hoping to fall in love with this light like I have the other ThruNite's I own. However with all the issues I have had, looking back, I wish I would have gone with another flashlight.",the united states,"November 8, 2019",Ryan,3.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:56.549998,2020-10-28 00:41:56.672205,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

222,RL54N7AZBB633,True,Insanely Bright for its size plus mini USB rechargeable feature..,"It's definitely the right size for edc. I open/conceal carry daily for many years when off duty and this flashlight fits the bill for the most part.
Improvements would be :
#1- It needs a button tailcap with strobe option like any other Thrunite flashlight (which I have) but keep the mode selector as is but let it stick out a little bit more and or textured it so i or others could feel it and actuate it without looking.

#2- Clip on the flashlight is okay but it would be a lot better if it was thicker and wider, it's going to be used thoroughly so it needs to withstand continuous use
(in and out of pant pockets).. And sometimes will be rough with it depending on the situation. Want to be able to put it back in the pocket quickly without looking and some pants are thicker than others so wouldn't want to accidentally break it too..

Other than that it's stupidly bright for its size which is an A+ for edc world, the rechargeable feature is another A+ too and i would recommend it to others who do what I do or not, definitely with the modification I just wrote and when that TC15 V2 is ready I'll buy it in a Flash...",the united states,"November 8, 2018",Jon,4.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:56.676197,2020-10-28 00:41:56.828935,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

223,R3FDXN1DNGA5FN,True,It Turns Night into Day,"On the positive - it is a solid and durable flashlight. I am in Central America right now, and it is the rainy season. Usually we can navigate by starlight, but the sky is covered in blankets of clouds. Have no fear! This flashlight lights up everything in the dark of night and storms! I also appreciate how quickly it recharges! Lastly, the accessories and inclusive replacement parts are awesome. ThruNite understands field-wear!

Be careful though - depending on the charge, the maximum illumination will suck the life out of the battery; its estimated duration is about two minutes on a fully charged battery. Also on max, the lens area gets HOT!

The only negative - I like a power/mode switch on the bottom of the flashlight as a thumb switch button. This flashlight's switch is on the cylinder, and when the flashlight is wet, it can be a challenge to feel/find it. I have aligned the pocket clip with the switch to mitigate the issue, and it helps a little.

PRO: HIGH 2300 Lumens and compact.
Con: POWER SWITCH: ON /OFF SWITCH: Location is on the body of the flashlight. my preference is a tail cap switch whereby I can easily USE MY STRONGER THUMB -NOT MY INDEX FINGER to power up the flashlight.
In attempting to USE MY INDEX FINGER to locate the power-up switch on the THRUNITE TC-15 2300 LUMENS flashlight was a bit ANNOYINGLY AWKWARD. Despite the indicator light on the body of the flashlight; I kept on fumbling the ThruNITE TC-15 in between my fingers my pocket trying to locate the INDEX FINGER POWER ON SWITCH. Luckily I had my BACK UP -The THRuNITE TC-30.
I charged the BATTERY overnight-Results: Flashlight; ONLY Low mode works ok. Charge indicator light Color: PURPLE-Flashlight not charging. Will UPDATE Tomorrow.
BRIGHTNESS LEVELS: Comparing brightness levels to the popular TC-12 1000Lumens was currently hard to determine.

CONCLUSION:
PRO:
USB RECHARGEABLE 3100MAH BATTERY.
EXCELLENT STRONG DIE Cast Aluminum body and pocket clip design.
CON:
INDEX FINGER POWER ON BODY SWITCH IS A DEFINITE DEAL BREAKER. This is a flashlight to keep around PLUGGED
Into your computer FOR EMERGENCIES AT HOME ---not as a DEPENDABLE pocket carry EDC.
Would I buy THE THRUNITE TC-15 2300 again? NO.
REASON: INDEX FINGER BODY POWER ON SWITCH. Slow re-CHARGING

227,R15MUDBZIRTVNP,True,Can be too hot to handle!,"Everyone should know that when you receive this light you have to take apart to remove all ot the batery insulators placed inside to prevent the light from turining on. There may be a reason for this. Once you put it back together it will work. Thrunite needs to put this notice right on top of the light inside the box when it is opened. However, the light can be a potential fire hazard. That's why the insulators are there... to prevent the light from accidently being turned on during shipping. Here's why I know this to be true:

I used the light one time, shut it off (at least I thought I did), and put the light in its case into my leather jacket pocket. For 2 hours after that I kept smelling something like burning popcorn, but I did not pay attention to it since the store I was in had a popcorn machine. Then I went to take it out of my pocket and realized that my pocket was really hot, and that as I went to take the light out, the light case and the light was so hot that I could not handle it. I realized I must have hit the switch accidently in my pocket, and did not know it had turned on to turbo light in its case! The light was not on, but I had to use the case to handle it and take it to a rest room to pour water on it to cool it down. If it had been in my pocket a while longer, it would have completely burned thorugh it. I recharged the flashlight, and now it is working correctly. I gave it four stars because of this encounter with it, which I now know how to prevent. Make sure you use this flashlight t with caution! I give it five stars for great brightness in the night, but I am not sure about the safety of the switch and the battery. This has not happened again, but I am still cautious.

228,R1M7H5SX8TSQ4Q,True,ThruNite ROCKS!,"BLUF: Buy this flashlight, you won't be sorry!

I own several ThruNite products -- five TN12's, two universal battery chargers, two C2's, and several 18650 batteries. All ThruNite products are TOP NOTCH. I saw the TC15 and decided to order a couple.

Pros:
Like all ThruNite products, the build quality is fantastic. Lightweight but solid feel. As much as everyone desires bright lumens, the 1 lumen 'firefly' mode is great when driving at night and your passenger is trying to read a paper map. (Yes, they still make those.) The opposite of that, 'turbo,' is amazingly bright! So bright you could practically land aircraft in your backyard. USB charge is also a nice feature as is the LED color indicator lets you know it's time to recharge it. Cycling through the brightness modes is easy, and each brightness level seems a good step from one to the other for the various conditions you desire to light.

Con but not a deal breaker:
Like others have said, because the on/off switch is flush with the flashlight body, it's more difficult to find. It would be nice if the on/off switch were out-dented or rear-mounted.

229,R24LOHPJAA2KIA,True,The best bang for your buck.,"Having done a lot of research and reading forum posts from communities of people who seem to be way too obsessed with flashlights. I decided that this brand is hands down the best.

One of the big selling points is that this brand has a good reputation for being accurate with their advertised lumen ratings as these obsessed people have tested their output themselves.

It is very common for other brands to not even come close to what their ratings claim.

One note however. Once you get to about 1000 lumens, the human eye can't really tell much difference when it goes higher than that.

Turbo mode is noticable from the high mode but it looks to the human eye maybe a quarter brighter than high mode. Even though it's over double the lumens.

What turbo mode is for is blinding people. Those extra lumens might not look that impressive from a visibility standpoint. However it'll overload someone's retinas something fierce. Even in broad daylight, it you hit someone in the eyes with this, they are going to be blind for a while.

Compare this to other reputable brands like Surefire, Nitecore, or Olight and this price is amazing.",the united states,"April 11, 2020",Ash,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:41:57.616823,2020-10-28 00:41:57.739178,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

230,R5U3NQP4G9E52,True,Don't buy,"Update: I never got a reply from customer service about my replacement. Glass broke while using turbo for a few seconds.. No way to replace it. Better go with something that has good customer service/support. Would not recommend after this was never resolved. I held odd on the review for more than a year and never heard anything back from them.
This flashlight is super bright on the turbo setting and the rest of the settings are great too. I thought I was not gonna like the one button for both power on and mode change since I had a bad experience with another flashlight turning on on turbo inside my back pocket and literally burning my right cheek.
Anyway, I like the power indicator on the button that lights up when charging and when the flashlight is in use. One thing you might want to keep in mind, this flashlight gets extremely hot on turbo mode, I had it on turbo for about a minute and it got so hot I burned my hand when I grabbed it past the button trying to turn it off, that's when my friend who was in front of me noticed that the glass had cracked.
I'm not too sure on how it happened or if it even was related to the flashlight being too hot when using it on turbo mode.
I have not dropped this flashlight at all since I got it and I haven't used turbo for extended periods of time either.
My guess is that the glass was cold due to the low temperature in the morning and the sudden heat from the light caused the glass to break.

All in all, this is one awesome flashlight, capable of charging via micro USB without the need of taking out the battery, and a high lumen output at a very useful range.

And when people send them back for repairs or replacement they check them out and fix the problems! Knock on wood I've never gotten a thrunite bad flashlight! I bought this one for my uncle it's his birthday today he's never had a decent flashlight! Now he does! And what I recommend this flashlight yes! So remember this! These flashlights are made and China just like everything else! So someone somewhere it's going to get a bad one or two so take this as it is but it's a great flashlight I'm going to purchase another one soon I think it's even better then the thrunite tc 12 hate to say that but smaller and brighter and still has onboard charger micro USB.,the united states,"June 25, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:42:01.985961,2020-10-28 00:42:02.108910,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

The ThruNite TC15 2300 is in that elite Group of Torches. It takes a lot of options, functions and durability in my opinion to make it in this category, and the ThruNite has all of this. I think most of all the main thing the light MUST live up to are the Lumen claims by the manufacture. And there are a plethora of so called ""high output"" flashlights on the Market but VERY few make it to that level. This Torch performs at all these levels.

234,R2NPQ1KVWXZNP9,True,Unbelievable light output from this little torch!,"UPDATED Mar. 2020

Still loving this light after having it about a month. I have bought 2 more since my first purchase. These WILL be my go-to camping lights. One thing I have noticed was my first purchase cost me $49.44 on Amazon. About a month later, the going price on Amazon is $65.99. Because of the rapid Amazon price increase, I bought my second and third lights from another (non-Amazon) source for $50 each, with free shipping.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I'm a bit of a light nut, as my wife would be quick to tell anyone. I started accumulating LED lights way back when the AAA ARC was the EDC everybody was impressed with. I still have the ARC. The problem is; LED lights keeps getting better and better, and they left the original ARC in the dust long ago. So onward goes my quest for the perfect LED torch...

Over the years I have owned many very good LED lights, including Fenix, RovyVon, Coast,
Nitecore, and ThruNite. In fact, the Nitecore EA4 is the very reason I came over to ThruNight. I had the EA4 for a year or so, and only occasionally used it to see what was going on outside. Even though I babied it, and it got very little usage, one day it just quit working. That's when I found the warranty would cover a replacement, *IF* I shipped the dead light back to China. After finding out it would cost less to replace it myself than ship it back, I bought my first ThruNight... a TN4A HI. The TN4A HI was another 4xAA torch which I bought to replace the dead Nitecore EA4. The ThruNite version had a better user interface, firefly mode, and has so far outlasted the Nitecore by many years. This is how my love for ThruNite lights began.

At this point, I now have no fewer than 4 ThruNite lights… with the T1 and TC15 being my most recent additions. Why do I like them so much? A lot has to do with the simple and intuitive user interface (switch operation). Unlike the varying switch operations on all my Fenix lights, the ThruNite lights all operate the same. Hold for firefly. Fast double-click for turbo. Fast double-click from turbo to get to strobe. Simple. Intuitive. Consistent across the brand.

Now on to the TN15… I was not expecting too much from the TN15 since I have the very capable and insanely bright (though somewhat large) TN4A HI as a reference. Surprise, surprise. The tiny TN15 throws almost as far, and with a much wider view. It lights the back yard like it is day… 300+ feet back to my little barn. I was actually looking specifically for something with decent throw in a smaller size (pocket carry) than the TN4A HI. I am amazed, and thrilled with the TN15! It’s everything I had hoped it would be. I’m thinking the TN15 is going to be my camping go-to light from now on, which mean I’ll probably be getting another to stash in the RZR. Don’t tell the wife...",the united states,"February 18, 2020",Amazonian,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:42:02.389691,2020-10-28 00:42:02.518715,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

235,RLW3WKE7OQL8O,True,I found my new favorite flashlight," Best flashlight Ive ever used. small, uses standard 18650 batteries, micro usb rechargable, water proof, and crazy bright. I can carry this with me hiking and recharge it off my battery backup and solar panel like i do my phone, watch, and other electronics. I also tested it against my Police Officer buddy's issued ""stinger"" flashlight which USED to be my goal for brightness and as you can see in my video, the TC15 blows it out of the park. It should be noted that the high mode which this light can stay on until dead is around 1000 lumens which is STILL brighter than the police flashlight, but the 2300 lumens can only be on for about a minute or so at a time. The light gets too hot and it starts to dim down to lower brightness to stop the flashlight from becoming dangerously hot. that is not a limitation of this flashlight, just led technology as a whole. However having the ability to flood a whole area for over a minute is more than ive ever used it for. a quick peek over a large area then its back to medium or low mode for general walking.",the united states,"September 6, 2020",Robert,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:42:02.524161,2020-10-28 00:42:02.658948,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

ThruNite customized 26650 battery has a protective board, and the function of the lithium battery protection board is mainly to protect the battery from overcharging or over-discharging.

TC20 uses a 26650 battery (with flat button), any kind of 26650 battery could be used for ThruNite; but look for protected brands.

237,R2JGU3FBFRE8QQ,True,Works well with minor issues,"I'm going to keep this short.
The flashlight is small and very bright, and the best part is that it charges with a micro usb cable.
No need for external chargers. I found this great for giving as a gift.
I was scared that the button would be too easily pressed, considering it doesn't use the common two button system. But it works just fine and doesn't get turned on unintentionally in my pocket.

The only con is that the button seems to be a hit or miss every once in a while. Sometimes it just doesn't turn on or change modes unless is press it very hard. Its only happend about 2 or 3 times since I've owned it.

238,R33J1DA6PK9106,True,Honest Novice Review,"I am not a flashlight expert. I was buying one for everyday carry for use while hunting, walking the dogs at night, odd jobs around the house etc.,...and one I could find when needed. All I have to do is look in my pocket. So, I researched by reading reviews, watching Youtube videos and looking all over the internet. I landed on this one for many reasons including the fact that it was powerful and threw a lot of light. I give this light 4 stars for the following reasons.

Positives:

1. The turbo is brilliant. WOW. It reaches out a long way and floods the surrounding area. I didn't think anything this small could compete with a big battery powered Maglite but, was I wrong. It is cool.

2. The build quality is great. No complaints at all.

3. The ability to recharge through the standard USB port is great. No buying batteries or removing the battery to plug into the side. Just flip the rubber cover on the side of the light and insert. It made a lot of sense to me not to get the lights with special disc chargers that magnetically attach to the bottom of the light. I can never find Apple Watch chargers or often forget to take them with me. And, they get lost needing to buy new ones. But, I always have blocks and cords in my backpack for phones, speakers etc. This is a big plus.

4. The kit includes extra parts which is terrific.

Negatives:

Now, to get a little nitpicky:

1. The silver on/off/selector switch is hard to find by feel. It blends in with the contours of the areas around it so you will be searching for it and confusing it with the charging port. Why Thrunite didn't put a raised rubber switch here is a miss. I have to align the pocket clip with the button so I know where it is in the dark by feel alone.

2. The high setting (not turbo) could be bumped up a little. I would sacrifice the battery life to get a better stream on high.

Is it worth the $$---absolutely!!! With all that you get and the warranty, I am very satisfied with my purchase.

239,R2ZZI7JENV2TFL,True,Above the rest,"As somewhat of a flashlight aficionado, I've certainly spent countless hours researching different brands, styles, and models of flashlights (Nitecore, Thrunite, Sofirn, Acebeam, etc). Of those brands and their various 18650 style flashlights, Thrunite has demonstrated impressive and consistent performance with their TC12, TN12, and TC15 models. As already mentioned in the description, the flashlight has many different modes (firefly, low, medium, high, turbo, strobe) that are adjustable per your discretion. A night walk back to your dorm from a late class? High mode gives you plenty of light and distance, though be wary of blinding others coming your way! Need to find something in your car at night? Low mode is perfect for that. Impromptu disco party during your sleepover? Strobe mode has your covered.

240,R2J01XT2L5RILN,True,Excellent flashlight!!!,"Great little flashlight. I love the brightness and size. It's very easy to use and very easy to switch between the many different modes. I already have many 18650 batteries and several battery chargers, but I love that I can just hookup a micro USB to charge it. I wish it was USB-C, but that's because my cell phones for the past 2+ years have been USB-C so I have many of those laying around (I still have plenty of micro USB cables because of many other things that still use micro USB like my bluetooth wireless headphones, etc).

The one star reviews are from people that didn't take out the little piece of plastic that is between the anode (battery pin) and the battery terminal that probably was put there to prevent it from being turned on while in the box. The people that did not figure this out before they decided to post a 1 star review look a bit foolish to me. In my opinion, it makes those reviewers appear to lack a little bit of logic, reason and common sense. As soon as you plug in the charger (before removing the tiny piece of plastic between the anode and the terminal) the light will start blinking purple. That means ""abnormal charging,"" and is stated in the instructions. As soon as I plugged in the charger and saw the blinking purple light I knew that it was charging abnormally because I read the instructions before I even plugged in the micro usb to begin charging. I quickly realized that something might be wrong with the battery, so I took out the battery and saw the small plastic circle between the anode and the light. So, I removed the little plastic circle and plugged in the micro USB again. Once plugged in, the light was red, notifying me that the battery was charging. Instantly, I felt foolish for not opening up and looking at the battery before I tried use it or to charge it. I can only imagine how foolish the reviewers that only gave this 1 star must feel. I guess that's why I always wait more than 10 minutes before I post a review on something... especially if something like the blinking purple led or the fact that the light works while plugged in (but only in 2 different modes/intensities), but it doesn't work when unplugged, would make me think that I am doing something wrong or that something specific needs to be done before it will work correctly. I certainly wouldn't give it 1 star without trying to figure out what the problem is or calling customer service or doing a quick internet search, etc first.

241,R2GPRV1DGQ54FZ,True,It does charge fine. Please read if you have issues.,"I bought this for the high light output and quality. I have a Ti3 also and the build quality is excellent. I read a lot of negative reviews and most were due to charging issues. I found there was some oil on the forward battery contact surface that prevented it from charging. I wiped the surface with some alcohol and it charges fine now. Also when I received it I found a plastic disk inside to protect the battery from discharging. This must be removed by unscrewing the forward portion of the light. It unscrews both at the front and back. The barrel is reversible so you can have the clip facing forward or back. All together this is an amazing light. The 2300 lumen mode will run for about 2 minutes then it will drop to about 820 lumen which is still very bright. It will run continuously at 1050 lumens untill it runs out.. I.e. 1050 lumens is a standard mode, not a turbo mode and it is bright. I prefer the neutral white, it's not too yellow. I don't like cool white but that's a personal preference. This flashlight uses an IMR 18650 which allows high current draw but you will get a little less total capacity. If you can forgo the 2300 lumen setting you will get a little more capacity with the TC12 or Neutron 2C but I really like the 2300 lumen option. You can disregard the negative reviews due to charging issues since you can just wipe the contact surface.

243,R3HLGU26E695GZ,True,Flashlight junkie approved with a caveat,"I'm not really a full blown flashlight junkie but there is a grain of truth there. I have A Zebralight, Fenix, and older ThruNite, and some other well known quality brands. I always thought my older ThruNite was as good or better than my Fenix PD35 so I thought I'd give this new model a try. I choose the neutral white and I really like the natural color the beam projects. Don't let that fool you though, this sucker is bright and it is a nice balance of throw and flood, but it is definitely more of a ""floody"" style of light if that matters to you. I said there was a caveat and that is why the four star rating instead of five. The first unit I ordered arrived completely DOA. I have a trove of 18650 batteries so I used some of my batteries but it was still DOA, and back it went. The replacement flashlight is great and is definitely worthy of a five star rating. ThruNite stands by their gear so don't trash them until you give them a chance to make it right if you encounter a problem.

244,R339BUO24MTFHL,True,Perfect flashlight,"I bought this product because I start work early in the morning and it's hard for me to see in the dark. I'm a custodian for an elementary school and unfortunately where I live we have quite a bit of homeless people so once in a great while when I go in on a Monday I'll catch one or two homeless people that I have to tell them to leave so that's where this comes in handy. We have a few dark areas of the school that I'll see them sometimes so I'll use it there but this thing doesn't just light up that area itll light up that whole side of the school!

247,R2I63UZQHBBM90,True,Lots 'O Light,"I loved this little flashlight so much that I later bought another, so I now have a cool white and a warm white. Then I bought the super-duper long-throw version with the larger head and was impressed even more!

I have a buddy who works as a dealer service technician and he has helped me so much, so I asked him which light was better for working on his cars. He chose cool white but told me that for everyday use he'd rather have warm white. I gave him the cool white as a token of my appreciation.

He texted me that it lasts not just all day long, but several days, before he has to recharge it. His old one was not as bright and it was starting to die quicker, so this was perfect timing, too.

I still haven't bought another to replace that one, but I'm sure I will. These are that good!

I like the way it feels (small, easy to hold), and love the great amount of light available at multiple levels. It's really easy to use: press power to turn it on to last setting, hold it to cycle through low, med, and hi. Turn it on by holding the button and I get a light that doesn't mess with my night vision, but I usually use a cheap red headlight while doing night photography, so I don't need this feature as much. The super-bright comes after double-clicking the power, then doing that again puts it into strobe mode. The user interface is easy to understand and use, which is why I got the long-throw from the same folks: so I wouldn't have to remember different ways to turn them on.

It gets warm when on for awhile, but not too warm even on a day/night in the upper 80's. I've never run it completely empty so I can't say how long it lasts ""to the last drop"", but I've never been without light when reaching for it, which is all anyone can ask of a flashlight. Additionally, as small as it is, it's very easy to use just about anywhere and it fits inside the little pocket on my cargo pants, even when driving.

No complaints at all. I'd like to see an optional end cap with a button in it to turn it on/off, but that's just me being finicky. By aligning the clip with the power button, I can find it in the dark every time.",the united states,"August 30, 2019","Just Me, Bob",5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:42:09.227140,2020-10-28 00:42:09.349067,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

My first test was to see each brightness in my living room with all the windows and blinds open. Each level of brightness is still visible even in broad daylight which is nice. My next test was to compare my 1300 lumen flashlight versus the thrunite in a bathroom with no windows (pitch black). Even the medium power on the thrunight seemed to be brighter and more crisp than the highest setting on my old light. Turbo mode, let’s just say I accidentally blinded myself momentarily trying to see exactly how bright this thing is.

I typically ride my bike to work when it’s not raining and with winter coming up, I’m expecting some evening rides home with low light. Looking forward to having this flashlight accompany me on those rides especially given the size of the body/tube.

251,R307JI0X6GPFXB,True,I did the math and it doesn’t add up.,"At the risk of incurring the wrath of some ThruNite fan boys and/or sales rep, I did the math and it doesn’t add up.

The CREE XHP 35.2 has a Max Lumen rating of 1718 lm with a typical forward voltage of 11.2 V @ 350 ma so even if the LED driver is boosting the 3.7 v from the battery its hard to believe the Lumen rating. If you notice the higher end flashlights never boast Lumen ratings higher than specs and there is a reason for that. (They also coat the O ring on the end cap with silicone and use a battery protector instead of simply loosening the body to protect against accidental turn on during shipment.)

Glad I had read reviews as there was a non-conductive disc at the battery positive contact AND reviews detailed how to use switch. Disc was stuck and required needle nose pliers to pull off. Also, purple light on when charging, not red. Finally resolved by loosening/tightening the cap. Description SHOULD say this comes with a nice lanyard as well as a sheath (holster). It did not so I ordered a generic sheath which I now do not need. Will update after use.
Update: I continued to have charge issues (purple light) until I wiped all contact surfaces with rubbing alcohol; now it seems to work. BTW: ground contact is not thru threads as they are anodized; it is thru cylinder end face to contact with cap inside.
Update 2: Works good now and very bright. Only negative I have is that it is hard to get into strobe function.

257,R6QRC9898X5MM,True,Great edc light but had issue after 2 wks,"This is not a complete full review because there are plenty of em already posted by others regarding its construction, material etc. Rather this is just a brief summary about what i like and don't like about the unit as of this initial review.
Cons:
- Main issue for me was lack of thumb operation button. This is not a deal breaker for me because there is a way to work around it. All of my other lights are operated with the rear thumb button so I've trained and became accustomed to it. So when I first handled the light, I was disappointed because the unit is operated with the side button. I thought I would have to retrain myself to hold the light in a different manner than my other lights and also in a different method of operation. However after playing with it for some time, I have been able to adapt and overcome this issue so that I still hold the light in the same manner as my other lights (thumb over rear). The only difference is that the operation of light is done with the pinky finger rather than the thumb. I placed the pocket clip so that it lines up with the side button. I use this as a reference point so that I hold the light the same way everytime and places my pinky over the side button without having to look at the unit. (I've attached pictures).

Pros:
- I like being able to jump directly to the firefly mode from the off position with just pressing the button and holding it for 3 sec.
- Also, when in any mode, I like being able to jump to the turbo mode by pressing the button and holding it for few seconds.
- Option to charge via usb. This is useful when traveling internationally because finding batteries in remote cities/villages will be a challenge.
----------
After using it for about 2 wks, the side button is starting to stick. I press it on and it sticks at one of the edges and light will go through the different modes if not corrected.
I use my lights daily and need it to work without issues so I'm returning it.
To be fair and the reason I downgraded to 3-star vs 1, I didn't reach out to company about the issue. Regardless of their reply, I would return it anyways because I don't feel too confident in a small side button as the only operating method and one that will last (according to how I use my light).

There are definite benefits over the last $10 LED flashlight I purchased. This light has a more balanced and neutral color.

The multiple modes are generally well thought out and would be potentially useful. The light is smaller there isn't any wasted space.

The TC20 is a little too bulky and heavy to carry in a front pocket, but it runs noticeably cooler and will run for a lot longer for those times when you're working on a project and need a lot of light for an hour or more. If you only have room for one, I'd suggest getting the TC15. I would say it's about 80% as bright as the TC20, although the beam is a bit more focused, so you don't get as much coverage. But still, the TC15 would be my choice if I only wanted to own a single light.

I was super concerned about the tinting of the light (CW vs NW), but after owning them for a week or two now, I don't think the light tint was nearly as big of a deal as I thought it would be. I had to special order the NW versions, and now that I look at the beams, they are definitely more yellow tinted than I thought they would be. Not a bad thing, just not what I expected. I think I would have been perfectly happy with the CW tint, too. Not worth jumping through hoops to get the NW tint, in my opinion.

Anyway, you can't go wrong with this light. It's easy to use, ruggedly constructed, and super bright for its size. It does run a bit hot though, so if I need a lot of light for 30 mins or more, I'll switch to the TC20.",the united states,"January 22, 2020",Carla,5.0,0,2020-10-28 00:42:16.837626,2020-10-28 00:42:16.959730,"ThruNite TC15 2300 Lumens LED Flashlight, Ultra-Bright USB Rechargeable Flashlight with CREE XHP 35 LED, EDC Handheld Flashlight for Camping, Hiking, Security and Emergency Use (TC15 NW)",4.5,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07JCFY3N4,,"#2,116 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

267,RQXQR96YA93KD,True,Super bright and affordable torch,"I'm a big fan of Thrunite. Besides this light, I've owned their TH-10 headlamp for a couple years. I put that thing through hell, and it never failed me. So when I started a new position on night shift I wanted a new light and I found this one. It's a tough flashlight. I've already dropped it way more than I should have so I attached the included lanyard to it now. I also like the included holster and I wear it everyday. The 18650 battery is convenient for me since I vape and already own external battery chargers. If you purchase this I recommend getting an external charger; I've personally have bad luck with micro USB charging on many devices so I don't use it here. I'd love to see USB-C in a future light! Switching light modes is easy, the power switch feels nice to click. I love the 'firefly' mode for when only a little illumination is needed. I use the turbo mode about once a night when checking on some tanks outside; just climb to a good vantage point and blow up the whole area. It will get warm pretty quick in turbo but honestly for me I don't need to use it very long. If you need 2300 lumens constantly, you might need another (bigger) light for the job.

My only gripes would be that I really wish it was USB C instead of micro usb, and would prefer if it had dual springs instead of just a single tail cap spring. Also something a little more petty, is that there isn’t really much texturing on the tailcap so it’s easy for your hands to slip when you’re trying to swap out the battery.

I got the new one and it was doing the same thing. I started reading more of the reviews because I couldn't believe I got two lemons in a row.

only one : the switch is hard to find by feel, e.g. if I pull it out of my pocket in a dark place I will fumble around trying to find the switch. However, if I align the pocket clip ( which obviously means I have to use it ) with the switch, that makes the switch much more easy to find.

My only complaint is the design flaw of a side button that's so easy to accidentally be turned on. Today at work, while sitting in my car for my lunch break, I had the flashlight in its belt holster. At some point, I leaned against the light, and turned it on by accident. I only realized it once I felt a sharp pain at my waist. I took the flashlight out and it was absolutely too hot to touch. Had my shirt not been tucked in and had the ""protection"" of the fabric holster, I would have had serious burns. Imagine if that happened while driving. I couldn't believe how hot the entire metal body got from end to end. I barely got the light out of the holster without burning the hell out of my fingers.

This is mainly so that there will be light for her to see, but also since it is so extremely bright, hopefully God forbid if she ever did have to use it to blind an attacker, I have every confidence in the world the the brightness of this torch will thoroughly do the job.

Right away after receiving this light I could tell that it was quality from the make of the box and its heft for a small flashlight.
Everything was packaged expertly and in perfect condition. Once I tightened up the battery compartments the light began to work.
This light is super bright. Extremely easy to use. The interface is simple on or off and easy to get to other settings as well.
Only thing that I found a bit difficult was getting the lanyard string through that itty bitty tiny hole. I managed to do this with the aid of a paperclip.

296,R23INULRH7RI8K,True,Fantastic EDC flashlight,"I did a lot of research before choosing an EDC flashlight, and in the end chose this one due to its 1-lumen firefly/starlight mode, it's crazy high 2000+ lumen turbo (which is real according to the lumen measures I have at home), and how long it can last at 1000+ lumens.

The only negative reviews I read when doing research mentioned size, heat, and a hard-to-find-by-touch button. I have to say the size is perfect for me; not at all difficult as a pocket EDC in a pair of (men's) jeans or slacks. The heat ""problem"" is real, though it's simple physics and actually not at all a problem for me to continue carrying the flashlight ""normally"" (ie not putting your hand on the part of the light where the LED is or higher). It's quite warm, but not painful to hold at all. This is the best light I've ever bought for this purpose. The only thing I'd change about it if I could would be to give it a tail switch. I can pull a light out and turn it on much faster with a tail switch, and I like carrying lights in that position. However I'll say that the solution to finding the nearly-flush button is just to line up your pocket clip with the button so you can follow the line in the dark.

The only thing keeping me from giving the TC15 full marks is that the lens came from the factory with a series of tiny scratches seemingly on the inside. Not a huge deal but not what I would expect for the money.

315,R6YZEJOUYK33J,True,Great Flashlight!,"User Interface - I really like the user interface. You click it once to turn it on and once to turn it off. You hold it to change from low-medium-high. It is very intuitive and allows you to have the perfect brightness level for any situation. The firefly mode is excellent. It's great for doing sensitive tasks, such as checking fish in a fish tank or maybe inspecting someone's eye without straining it with a brighter light. The turbo mode is great, but the light gets very hot. I like that I have the option if I really need it, but I will probably use the high setting 90% of the time outside. The build is solid, and I feel like this light will last a long time.

My only complaint is that it is difficult to find the power button by feel if you grab the light in the dark. Once it's on the power button lights up indicating the battery level, but it's flat against the body and difficult to find without that light. I'm thinking I'm going to attach a tiny piece of rubber to the power button so that it's easier to grab in the night.

322,RDIW46P7JD6CD,True,Great EDC flashlight!,"I’ve had this flashlight (NW version) for about 2 months now and it hasn’t let me down. I really enjoy the simple UI, the USB charging port (though I wish it was type-C), and brightness levels that were chosen. I usually keep the flashlight at medium brightness and it delivers enough light for all of my day to day tasks. The battery that ships with the flashlight is great as well. I’ve tried various other 18650’s in this light and they all work, however, make sure that you’re using a battery with a high enough discharge rate as the emitter draws quite a bit at high and turbo. Build quality is top notch. I’ve dropped it a few times onto concrete and haven’t had any issues, rattles, nothing. The reflector delivers a nice hotspot with useable flood. Things I think could be improved on would be the aforementioned small inconvenience of it not having a USB Type-C port and the button. It works well, clicks nicely and has a power indicator light built into it, however, I’ve found myself on multiple occasions fumbling around with the flashlight searching for the button with my thumb.

Interface becomes easy once you get used to it, battery life is amazing, I have carried it for 20 days with only 1 charge and it still going (it depends on your personal use), I carry it with the sheath it came with and that is all I need for my work and personal flashlight use.

It indicated it was fully charged but as the second week started it died out on the first use. I tried several more attempts to charge the battery with no avail.
