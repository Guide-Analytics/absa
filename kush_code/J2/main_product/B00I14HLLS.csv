0,R2F412RAPCI2JP,True,"Petite, légère et puissante","Je l'ai acheté pour le travail, mais finalement elle n'est pas assez puissante. Elle s'allume au réglage faible intensité et c'est pas assez pour que je puisse voir à l'intérieur d'un véhicule la nuit. La haute intensité est bonne, mais ça prend 3 clics pour se rendre là. Donc, je l'ai gardée pour mon usage personnel et dans ce sens elle est parfaite - petite, légère et assez puissante, en plus elle prend une batterie AA seulement.

1,R1PXL5OBKCT1MZ,True,The best pocket flashlight,"This is my second E12. I had the first one for more than a year. When I lost it, I wanted another one right away. I carry the E12 in my pocket all the time and use it several times each day.

Pros:
- It uses an AA battery.
- It turns on with a single click of the switch.
- It is always on low power when it turns on. Low power is adequate for most situations.
- If I need more light, a soft-press on the switch will cycle through the three available power settings.
- At high power it is very bright for a pocket flashlight.
- It turns off with a single click of the switch. I don't have to cycle through other settings to get to off.
- There is no flashing or strobe mode.
- It's waterproof.

Cons:
- It would be perfect if it had a harder lens that didn't get scratched jostling around with keys in my pocket.",canada,"September 1, 2017",RonAm,5.0,3,2020-11-12 11:45:37.015814,2020-11-12 11:45:37.132650,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2,R24549L1DNK0EE,True,I was very disappointed in this AA LED flashlight,"I have a similar AA-powered LED flashlight from Cabelas that I am quite happy with. I wanted this one because it is a little more compact and would fight on my leatherman holster. I have a lot of Eneloop rechargables AAs, and I don't like the idea of spending a lot of money on fancy flashlight batteries many models now use. I had heard Fenix was a great brand, so I bought this.
I was greatly disappointed with it, and would never carry it for primary usage. It is basically a last resort, if I can't find any of my other flashlights, including my maglights. I have recent bought some Nebo lights that work well. I don't know if I would buy another Fenix.

6,R8UD9VD82XQSB,True,which is easy to replace,"Very powerful flashlight, in a small package. The battery life is impressive too. One of the reasons I chose this flashlight, was because it took a single AA battery; which is easy to replace.
It has three brightness choices, all selected by a light tap of the power button. When you turn it off, it defaults back to the least-bright setting.

60,R24MFE26GHMEZ1,True,Wow,Wow. When I got this light I threw all my non-LED flashlights out: big (6v) flood light to regular hand held with D-batteries. I also don't use LED lights I bought in those Multi packs at HD anymore because this light is way brighter and amazingly small (maybe too small in size); about the size of lipstick tube (slightly bigger). I pretty sure there are more power lights of this size but with special batteries. This one runs on regular batteries and lasts months with intermittent use. And yeah I bought another so I could attach it to the available headband. Used this double light setup in the attic and it was very useful.,canada,"October 23, 2015",Pten,5.0,1,2020-11-12 11:46:06.488563,2020-11-12 11:46:06.597212,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

66,R13BXT2X406U8B,True,Excellent LED torch for easy every day carry,"The Fenix E12 is a very useful and compact LED torch. It runs on a single ""AA"" battery and it's not much larger than the battery that powers it. It's made from metal and comes with a small keyring, a wrist-loop and a tail switch. (Note that the smaller ""AAA"" Fenix E01 and E05 both use a rotating bezel for activation.) I have large 10-inch hands and the wrist-loop fits me perfectly.

The Fenix E12 has four settings, as follows: off, low (8 lumens), medium (50 lumens) and high (130 lumens). The tail switch is used to cycle through the settings. One full click turns the LED on at low, then a quick half-press of the tail switch changes the brightness to medium and again to high. From any of the three brightness settings you can use momentary-off, however the torch has no memory, so after one second the circuit resets and when you release the momentary-off it will default to the low setting. It's simple enough to cycle back up to medium or high brightness, as required.

The torch fits neatly into just about any pocket and is an excellent choice for every day carry. It's slightly too large for attaching to a set of car keys; the E05 is a better choice for that option. You can also attach the E12 to a flexible lanyard and attach the other end to your belt if you're worried about dropping it. Because the E12 uses a larger battery than the E05 (AA as opposed to AAA), the light output of the E12 is brighter at medium and high settings - in both cases the low setting is the same - and the larger battery will last longer.

The manufacturer states that the torch will last for 22hrs on low, 3.5hrs on medium and 1hr on high - the times are between 50%-100% longer for certain battery types. The quality of batteries you use will determine how long the torch lasts on a single cell. Zinc carbon batteries will get nowhere near these timings, whilst alkaline-manganese dioxide batteries should reach the lower timings and the new lithium-primary batteries will last even longer. Third-gen nickel-metal-hydride batteries (NiMH) with very high mAh capacity (and a professional charger) should produce the best results. On a safety note, make sure that the batteries you use do not exceed 1.5V of power. As of writing this review (DEC-2015), ""AA"" alkaline batteries produce 1.5V and NiMH produce 1.2V. Some types of lithium primary battery produce 3.7V and they will blow up the torch and injure the user.",the united kingdom,"December 18, 2015",Jinx,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:46:07.158853,2020-11-12 11:46:07.280527,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

67,R2FJXPWPAU2FKM,True,"Small, bright and tough","This is a great little torch for everyday use. Build quality seems very good, and it's a worthwhile step up from cheap torches, which eventually always seem to suffer from problems with switches or battery contacts.

The three brightness settings are ideal for me: 1 is bright enough for many tasks and lasts practically for ever; 2 is bright, with a respectable 4-hour runtime on NiMH, and 3 is super-bright for occasional use. Thankfully there's no ""SOS"" function or memory settings to complicate things.

Flashlight experts argue till the cows come home about the best way to access different brightness settings. This one seems simple and logical to me: click the tailcap to switch on in ""low"" mode, then briefly press the switch repeatedly to cycle through the three settings. I suspect experts would find fault with the beam pattern, but I've seen a lot worse.

76,R1367B582HHU57,True,A Great Compact Torch,"I great torch for either EDC or, in my case, to leave in the car with some lithium primaries for emergency use, as I have a Fenix E05 and LD12 for EDC.

This has the convenience of using AA batteries, whilst still getting a ridiculous amount of light and decent runtime from such a small device. There are 3 brightness setting and no strobe or SOS options, which is fine for a standard torch. It may not be ideal for survival or tactical use, but how many of us will find ourselves in that situation?!

The switch is a reverse clicky, so it's not possible to get momentary on, but when switched on a half press gives momentary off. A quick half press takes it to the next brightness level, but holding for longer than 1 second reverts it back to the lowest setting.

The battery tube is accessed by completely unscrewing the head, this also exposes the o-ring seal (of which there is a spare in the pack). The threads are anodised, so a part turn of the head will lockout the torch, preventing it being accidentally turned on.

There are 2 holes in the tail for fitting the supplied lanyard. It's easiest to loop it through only one hole, but this would prevent the torch from standing on its end. It is possible, but rather fiddly, to loop it through both holes (see photo). In my case it involved using a tiny hook to get it past the rubber switch cap...maybe I'm just missing an obvious, easy way to do it!

96,R2ZTLOUMH0FV8H,True,Ottima torcia con batterie AA con il miglior rapporto qualita'/prezzo.,"Cercavo una torcia molto piccola, semplice da usare (ha un solo tasto on/off, che se viene premuto a metà mentre è accesa serve anche per cambiare intensità luminosa), che facesse molta luce con le semplici batterie stilo AA e che fosse molto affidabile. Questa torcia mi ha soddisfatto in tutto.

Aspetti positivi:
+ fa realmente 130 lumens massimi
+ produce un cono luminoso molto ben concentrato, definito e di un gradevole colore bianco
+ possiedo anche una Olight S1A Baton (che è anche meglio di questa ma costa quasi il doppio) e una ThruNite T10 XP-L CREE LED (che costa poco di meno, dichiara una potenza massima di 252 lumens, ma in realtà fa meno luce di questa Fenix) e posso dire che questa ha il miglior rapporto qualità/prezzo.
+ ha tre intensità luminose molto ben azzeccate (si cambia intensità premendo a metà l'unico tasto che ha): 8 lumens, 50 lumens, 130 lumens
+ ha in dotazione un comodo cordino da polso
+ i materiali e le rifiniture sono ottimi
+ ha istruzioni (anche se l'utilizzo è banale) e garanzia anche in italiano
+ pesa effettivamente meno di 30 g
+ è piccola e maneggevole
+ si può alimentare con semplici batterie stilo AA (normali o ricaricabili), volendo anche con quelle al litio non ricaricabili (ma non con quelle al litio ricaricabili 14500)
+ impermeabile fino a 2 m di profondità per 30 minuti

Aspetti negativi:
- non memorizza l'intensità luminosa utilizzata per cui ogni volta la si accende a 8 lumens, per poi eventualmente passare a 50 lumens e quindi a 130 (ma la gestione risulta molto agevole perché il tasto funziona molto bene e come vi illustrerò di seguito con l'aiuto delle foto la potenza minima a cui si accende è comunque notevole).
- per chi ama avere una clips per agganciare la torcia alla cintura (io non sono fra questi) questa torcia non ne è dotata
- per assurdo avere la luminosità minima molto efficiente non è sempre un vantaggio, ci sono alcune situazioni (come quando devo andare in camera di mia figlia mentre dorme) nelle quali si può sentire la mancanza di avere una luce veramente fioca.
- non sono mai riuscito a trovare sconti su questa torcia (probabilmente proprio perché ha già un buon rapporto qualità/prezzo con margini moderati)

Sperando di fare cosa gradita inserisco tre foto per poter farvi valutare direttamente le differenze fra quelle che sono (attualmente) a mio avviso le migliori torce con semplici batterie stilo AA in vendita su Amazon (e me le sono comprate tutte perché sono appassionato di mini torce) ovvero questa Fenix E12, la Olight S1A Baton e la ThruNite T10 XP-L.
Vi descrivo cosa mostrano le foto (numerate da sinistra verso destra) per evitare confusione:
1 - ovviamente sono le tre torce
2 - a sinistra c'è una Olight S1A (alimentata da AA) alla potenza massima di 220 lumen, al centro c'è questa Fenix E12 alla potenza massima di 130 lumen e a destra la ThruNite T10 XP-L Neutral White alla massima potenza (che dichiarerebbe 252 lumen ma è evidente che in realtà ne fa molto meno). La Fenix E12 rispetto la ThruNite T10 XP-L fa in realtà più luce, con un cono molto migliore e una tonalità di bianco molto più gradevole. La Fenix E12 riesce inoltre ad avere praticamente la stessa intensità luminosa della S1A ma solo su un cono molto più concentrato.
3 - a sinistra c'è la Olight S1A alla potenza minima 5 lumen, in centro la Fenix E12 alla potenza minima di 8 lumen (che è quella a cui si accende ogni volta) e a destra la ThruNite T10 XP-L alla potenza media di 13 lumen (la T10 ha infatti le intensità a 0,5 - 13 - 252 lumen). Da questa foto di può ben vedere come gli 8 lumen della Fenix E12, grazie anche all'ottimo cono di luce concentrato, siano enormemente più efficienti delle altre due torce la cui luce in confronto praticamente scompare. Questa foto è un'ulteriore dimostrazione di come non ha senso orientarsi verso una ThruNite T10 XP-L solo perché è in grado di memorizzare l'ultima intensità luminosa, quella che vedete infatti è la seconda delle tre intensità della ThruNite e non è neppure lontanamente paragonabile al livello minimo della Fenix E12!",italy,"December 12, 2016",R&S,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:46:20.258743,2020-11-12 11:46:20.378423,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

105,R39YRQVZCM0BGU,True,"E12 - ""Taschen""lampe, die ihrer Bezeichnung gerecht wird.","Meine erste FENIX (bin bisher Nitecore und ThruNite - Nutzer) ist tatsächlich klein, leicht, kompakt und ziemlich hell - wobei ich hinter die angegebenen 130 Lumen schon ein kleines Fragezeichen setzen würde. Dennoch ist die E12 in dieser Hinsicht bzw. Lampenkategorie (1x AA mit Endtastenschalter) auch optisch derzeit vermutlich ohne nennenswerte Konkurrenz.
Zum Vergleich: meine ThruNite Archer 1A - ebenfalls mit 1 x AA und Endtastenschalter - ist deutlich länger, schwerer und mit größerem Durchmesser, dafür aber auch deutlich stabiler, gefühlt heller (mit kleinerem aber homogenerem Spot) und einer weiter nach innen versetzten und damit besser geschützten Glaslinse. Durch das stärkere und damit schwerere Gehäuse wirkt sie einfach wertiger.

Die E12 hat 3 vernünftig abgestufte Leuchtmodi, die über leichtes Drücken des Tastenschalters eingestellt werden. Beim Einschalten wird immer in der niedrigsten Stufe gestartet - im hellsten Modus wird sie recht warm. Der Spot ist rel. groß mit diffusem Rand. Sie liegt gut in der Hand und lässt sich aufstellen.

Was mich schon enttäuscht hat, ist der nicht besonders homogene und auch nicht richtig runde Spot und Leuchthof dieser Lampe, ganz zu schweigen von der schon öfters kritisierten Kunststofflinse, die noch dazu fast bündig vorne abschließt. Schnelles Verkratzen ist damit vorprogrammiert. Auch das Aufschrauben des Lampenkopfes ist im Gegensatz zur Archer etwas hakelig/kratzig.

Fazit: die E12 ist eine schöne, handliche und ausreichend helle ""Immer-dabei-Lampe"" mit kleineren Mängeln, mein FENIX-Bild ist dennoch leicht angekratzt (vermutlich muss man bei dieser Marke in höhere Preisgefilde aufsteigen). Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis geht noch so in Ordnung.",germany,"June 21, 2016",Joseph Erhardt,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:46:25.492367,2020-11-12 11:46:25.605065,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

109,R30CA0F9KP3HIU,True,A dissapointment rather than an upgrade from the fenix E11,"I originally had a fenix E11 a few years back, That was a nice flashlight, it felt solid and high quality.
It took tons of beating and throwing about. Functions were basic but very well though out. Sadly I lost that light and thought I'd buy the replacement. The E12.

Functionality had changed for the worse, but I was willing to live with that since I knew Fenix do great lights.
But now in hand, I'm really dissapointed. The light feels cheap, made from thinner aluminium. Switch feels really cheap too, and the tailcap feels flimsy.

The light boasts a TIR lens, Which normally gives a really nice focused beam with minimal spill.
That was by far the best feature of the E11, However the E12 Has lots of spill around an insanely tight hotspot.

- faible conso (1xAA)

- excellente résistance (je la gifle très souvent à plus d'1m de hauteur et...rien!)

Attention toutefois à la vitre de la lampe qui se raie car c'est du plastique et non du verre minérale comme les montre et donc elle floute peu à peu le point chaud ce qui aura pour conséquence de baisse la clarté de la lampe et de limiter le point chaud.

Für mich persönlich hat sie aber einen negativen Punkt, welcher mit extrem nervt und die Lampe für mich persönlich fast unbrauchbar macht: Mittlerweile hat sie die zweite Hosentasche meiner Hosen zerstört (Loch). Scheinbar sind die Kanten der Lampe zu scharfkantig für Tom Tailor Hosen. Deswegen muss ich leider eine Hülle einer alten LED Lenser Lampen benutzen, wodurch die Lampe sehr klobig wird. Die einfache Lösung hat Fenix leider vergessen beizulegen: den Pocket Clip.

Ich gebe an dieser Stelle aber trotzdem 4 Sterne, da ich der Lampe irgendwie nicht wirklich Schuld für die scheinbar schlechte Qualität meiner Hosen geben kann.

Ha tre potenze: la prima forse un po' troppo bassa, consente però una lunga durata della batteria. La seconda è a mio avviso un po' troppo simile alla massima. Fosse stata un po' meno potente avrebbe trovato impiego nelle situazioni più normali, consentendo un maggior risparmio della batteria, ma così secondo me ha poco senso. Della massima ho detto.

255,R6G9TP4UPT2HL,True,Excellent torch.,"Highly recommended! Well made and simple.
With good charge levels the three brightness levels are distinctive and each is definitely useful: frinstance: low good for in tent or close quarters, medium: good for night walking in familiar terrain, high: good for spotting burglars, foxes or aliens in the bushes etc.
If used every day it is best to use high output rechargeable NiMH AAs as these last longer in the torch with correct (relatively intensive) charge/discharge cycles. If used as an occasional or long term backup light then opt for an alkaline AA due to their longer charge retention.
Fits my adapted headstrap to create good backup headlight.

256,R1YTO5R20O87FA,True,高バランスの良いライト,"まず、商品紹介ページに、「High→Mid→Lowの順で点灯」と記載されていますが、正しくは「Low→Mid→High」の順で点灯」です。
最初に「Low」から点灯することが気に入っており、そこからテールスイッチ半押しですぐに「Mid」や「High」に切り替えることが出来ます。
ただ、「Mid」と「High」の差は少ないように感じます。
明るさは「Mid」でも十分です。

単三電池1本のライトはたくさんありますが、そのなかでもこれは小さいです。
ベストセラーの「パトリオ6」よりも全長・径共に小さいです。
また、本体は完全に円筒状で、途中で変な膨らみが無いことも小型化とすっきりしたデザインに寄与しています。

最近のフラッシュライトは、テールスイッチが出っ張っていて、ライトを机やテーブルに立てて置くことが出来ませんが、このライトは立てることが可能です。
日常生活で意外と立てて置きたい場面に遭遇することがあるため便利です。
災害時にも役に立つのではないでしょうか。
その代わり、テールスイッチが引っ込んでいるため少々押し難くなりますが、スリットを入れる等の工夫もあって許容範囲です。

本体のつくりは丁寧で高級感があります。
もともとFENIXは品質管理レベルが高く故障がし難いため永く使えると考えています。
これは他の数あるメーカーの品と比較すると分かります。
個人的見解になりますが、FENIXの品質管理レベルは「Surefire」並みだと思います。
（Surefireは専用電池を使わないと保証をしない、明るさが強（強過ぎ）と弱（弱過ぎ）の2段階しかない等で少々使い難い）
また、本体には傷が付き難い、ハードアノダイズ処理（タイプⅢ）が施されている点も高ポイントです。

最近はサイドスイッチが付き、更に高機能なモデルも出ていますが、こちらのE12の方がシンプルでコンパクトなので気に入っています。
余計な機能やスイッチは、それだけ不良・故障に繋がり、操作性も悪化します。
ストロボも余計な機能で使うことは無いと思います。
（ライト照射時にライトを振ることでストロボと同じ効果を出すことが可能）
また、明る過ぎるものは、発熱を持ったり、照射時間が限られていたり、逆に見難くて使い難いことがあるのでバランスが重要です。

このライトは地味ですがバランスに優れています。
セールスポイントをまとめると次の通りです。

1..必要最低限の機能（明るさ３段階・スイッチがテールに１つのみ）で使いやすい
2.立てて置ける
3.コンパクト（最近のものは大きくなりがち）
4.故障し難い（シンプルな機能でFENIXだから）
5.つくりが丁寧（レンズの淵やスプリング、表面処理等で分かります）
6.傷が付き難い（特殊表面硬化処理がされている）
7.単三乾電池1本で使用できる（安価で手に入りやすい）

不満な部分
1.電池持続時間が新機種と比較すると不足
2.間欠点灯、いわゆるテールスイッチ半押しで点灯不可（逆に半押しで消灯は可）

総じて良いライトですが、少し古い機種なので、いずれ手に入らなくなることが残念です。

Neue Taschenlampe ist angekommen. Außer einem etwas unförmigen Spot an einer Wand aus 1-2 Meter Entfernung kann ich keine Mängel feststellen.
-1 Stern Abzug, weil kein Clip mitgeliefert wird, obwohl der Tube sogar eine Aussparung hat, wo der Clip seinen Platz hätte.

26.01.15 - Das ist meine erste Taschenlampe von Fenix. Und das, was ich über die Marke gehört und gelesen habe, macht mich in diesem Fall ratlos. In keiner anderen Bewertung der Taschenlampe habe ich über Probleme mit dem Schalter gelesen.

ALso, TaLa war am Freitag bestekllt und Montag geliefert - ein + für den Verkäufer.

Lampe Ausgepackt - Verarbetung auf dem höchsten Stand!
Mitgelieferte Batterie rein und alle Funktionen probiert - alles Funktioniert ohne Probleme - mehrmals an und ausgeschaltet, Modi gewechselt - alles hat prima geklappt.

Da die Taschenlampe Mittags geliefert wurde, habe ich sie nach dem ersten Test weggesteckt, um Abends, bei Dunkelheit zu schauen, was die Lampe kann, wie hell sie ist und weit sie leuchtet usw. Aber nichts da - schalter gedrückt - nichts passiert. Eine neue Batterie rein - nichts passiert. Nach mehrmaligem betätigen des Schalters hat die Lampe geblinkt - also habe ich versucht, ohne dass die Lampe leuchtete, die Modi zu wechseln - da habe ich bemerkt, dass der Schalter so was wie ein Wackelkontakt hat - und die Lampe nur an ist wenn der Schalter entsrechend tief gedrückt wird - lässt man ihn los - geht de Lampe aus.

260,R1FBYS9CUVJ2AL,True,Fenix E12: Gute Lampe mit Verbesserungspotential,"Ich hab die Lampe seit zwei Wochen im Einsatz und bin bislang sehr zufrieden. Besonders gefällt mir an der Lampe, dass der Endschalter einen harten Druckpunkt hat und ein versehentliches Einschalten in der Tasche so gut wie ausgeschlossen ist. Leider bieten viele Konkurrenzprodukte genau das nicht und sind für mich daher nicht praxistauglich.

Die Lichtfarbe der Lampe empfinde ich als angenehm und weitgehend farbecht, wobei die Bezeichnung ""Neutralweiss"" für Thrunite-Nutzer etwas irreführend ist: Das Lichtbild der Fenix E12 ist bei weitem nicht so warm wie das Neutralweiss der Thrunite-Lampen, es ähnelt eher dem Lichtbild der ""Cool White""-Versionen von Thrunite. Wenn man diese beiden Marken wechselweise verwenden will, dann sollte man sich bei Thrunite für die Ausführung ""Cool White"" entscheiden, da die Umstellung auf eine andere Lichtfarbe für die Augen doch eine gewisse Anstrengung bedeutet.

Nun zum Verbesserungspotential:

1. Was mir an der E12 wirklich fehlt, ist der von Thrunite gewohnte Firefly-Modus! Die E12 ist schon auf der niedrigsten Leuchtstufe (8 lm.) so hell dass ich meine Frau damit aufwecke wenn ich des Nachts mal ins Badezimmer muss. Auch zum Angehen des Hochsitzes ist die E12 zu hell, einmal angeknipst und der ganze Wald weiss dass der Jäger kommt.
2. Die dünnwandige Gummierung des Endschalters macht keinen allzu vertrauenserweckenden Eindruck, mal sehen wie lange die hält.
3. Eine knallige Gehäusefarbe würde das Auffinden bei Dunkelheit erleichtern, eine Ausführung in Orange, Türkis oder Rot wär schön.

Insgesamt bin ich von der wirklich äußerst handlichen und gut verarbeiteten Lampe sehr angetan und würde sie jederzeit wieder kaufen.",germany,"April 20, 2017",P.M.,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:47:56.932613,2020-11-12 11:47:57.071126,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

261,R2QLKRUC0SGH0G,True,私のEDC!,"Amazonで初のフラッシュライトの購入です。2日後で届きました。
かなり満足しています。
選んだ理由は
1.主に野外(犬と散歩)で使うために光を数m〜数十m飛ばせること
2.軽いこと
3.単三一本で使えること
でした。
4.光を調節できること
でした。
以前はパトリオ4を使っていたのですが、
光があまり飛ばない、色が紫っぽく、単四のわりにヘッドが重い、滑り止めが滑るなどとても使いづらいものでした。
そして変える最大のきっかけになった理由は、犯罪に遭遇した時、犯人とすれ違ったのですが、光が弱く、顔をハッキリと照らせなかったためです。
なので何かあった時には出力を大きくできるものが欲しかったのです。

そしてスルーナイトのt10 2014とこちらに迷い、下のレビューを参考にこちらを選択しました。
Lowは室内でMidは屋外、Hiは何かあった時として使っています。
ただ、下のレビューにあるように、Hiは130あるようには見えないのが少し残念なので星4つになります。

262,R2M0EYSLEO2ZD,True,"Indistruttibile, impermeabile, piccola e potente","Da 6 mesi sono entrato in possesso di questa torcia davvero robusta. Spesso mi concedo giri notturni in montagna con gli amici per vedere le stelle o per il campeggio e devo dire che questa torcia mi ha molto sorpreso perché nonostante la sua estrema compattezza ha un fascio notevole di luce che è regolabile a tre diverse potenze. Essendo la mia terza Fenix in mio possesso posso francamente dire che la Fenix è una delle marche migliori sul mercato se non la migliore per la affidabilità, robustezza e impermeabilità. Sicuramente non sono economiche ma sono davvero ben progettate e realizzate, qui si sente la qualità di una torcia che è fatta per durare nel tempo e anche agli urti da caduta. Io questa torcia l'ho usata sotto la pioggia diverse volte e volontariamente ho voluto testare la sua impermeabilità in un fiume, mai una volta che si appannasse la lente o che ci siano delle perdite delle parti impermeabilizzate tramite degli Oring (ne forniscono uno di ricambio e devo dire non è affatto male averne uno di ricambio anche se questo è un aspetto minore). La consiglio vivamente perchè questa torcia oltre ad avere diversi aspetti positivi come raccontato prima non vi abbandonerà mai al buio per un malfunzionamento dovuto a quel minimo di elettronica che possiede. La mia torcia in particolare ha preso diverse forti botte cadendo da altezze di 3/4 metri su delle rocce in montagna, si è scalfita la verniciatura nera ma la torcia non ha mai accennato a smettere di funzionare, è davvero solida e sono sicuro che ne rimarreste soddisfatti. come durata della batteria devo dire che è piuttosto longeva ma come tutte le cose alimentate a batteria il fascio di luce più potente inizia a calare dopo circa 3 ore di funzionamento, è un affievolimento molto lento e non notereste la differenza in un uscita notturna anche di diverse ore. Super consigliata!! La foto che ho messo non rende il fascio di luce emesso ( anche per il fatto che si trova sott'acqua) ma vi assicuro che è estremamente divertente pocciarla nel fiume e vedere (se l'acqua non è torbida) i pesci! super super divertente!

279,R35NSY1K9PACAJ,True,Flutlicht aus der Tasche,"Eigentlich hatte ich zunächst etwas mehr an Taschenlampe erwartet, als ich das Amazon-Päckchen öffnete. Es enthielt zunächst eine kleine Taschenlampe (etwa handtellergroß), die zudem in einer geradezu einbruchsicheren Verpackung aufbewahrt wurde. Nach langem Kampf und mehreren Messer- und Scherenattacken gelang es mir dann tatsächlich, das kleine Ding zu befreien und zu begutachten. Etwas enttäuscht war ich auf den ersten Blick schon. Das sollte leuchten?

Nach einer ersten Montage von Batterie und Trageschlaufe und einem schnellen Blick in die Betriebsanleitung habe ich das Zimmer kurz verdunkelt und diese kleine Leuchte angeschaltet. Nach mehrmaligem Hochschalten (Knopf am Lampenende vorsichtig drücken) sprang plötzlich das Flutlicht an! Ich war total überrascht, was in diesem kleinen Taschenzwerg steckt. Wahrscheinlich könnte man mit dieser Power (aus einer einzigen AA-Batterie) die gesamte Allianz-Arena taghell ausleuchten - einfach unglaublich.

Zudem ist das Teil gut verarbeitet, eine Trageschlaufe liegt ebenso bei wie eine Batterie und eine Ersatzdichtung. Allein gegen das Wegrollen auf planer bzw. leicht geneigter Oberfläche ist die Lampe nicht so gut gesichert. Dafür lässt sie sich aufrecht hinstellen und so quasi als Kerze verwenden.

Insgesamt bin ich total zufrieden damit, zumal im alltäglichen Gebrauch sicherlich 1/3 der Lichtstärke ausreicht, um sich bsw. bei Dunkelheit im Zimmer oder Haus zu orientieren. Die Lampe trägt nicht auf, passt locker in jede Hosen- oder Handtasche und liefert bei Bedarf gnadenlos viel Licht ab.

288,R3CA4RBQYHXH6V,True,"Eine verbesserte E11? Nein, nur eine veränderte - aber auch eine gute Lampe für jeden Tag","Nachdem ich von der Fenix E11 als treuer Begleiter für jeden Tag sehr begeistert war, interessiere ich mich natürlich auch für deren Nachfolger. Die technischen Daten lasen sich erst einmal sehr gut: mehr Lichtleistung, mehr Leuchtstufen, dann auch noch kleiner und mit geschütztem Schalter. Mein Gedanke war, dass ich mir dieses kleine Meisterwerk gleich mal zulegen muss.
Also gleich bestellt und auf die Lieferung gewartet.
Bei der ersten E12 offenbarte sich leider direkt nach dem Auspacken ein (fabrikations?)Mangel: trotz gänzlich unbeschädigter Verpackung hatte die Linse einen recht großen Kratzer. Daraufhin habe ich die Lampe nicht weiter ausgepackt oder getestet, sondern gleich retourniert.
Heute kam dann die zweite an. Bei der achtete ich noch im unausgepackten Zustand auf eventuell sichtbare Mängel, konnte aber zum Glück keine entdecken. Dann war der Mangel bei der Erstlieferung hoffentlich nur ein Ausrutscher.
Die E12 liegt dank ihrer geringen Größe (für eine Lampe mit einer AA-Batterie und mit Schalter) sehr gut in der Hand und das Gehäuse ist sehr griffig gestaltet. Im Gegensatz zu ihrem Vorgänger fällt bei der E12 positiv auf, dass man sie auf den Boden stellen und als ""Kerze"" nutzen kann, da der Schalter mit einem Rand umgeben ist. An diesem lässt sich z.B. auch eine Schlaufe anbringen. Das ist umso erstaunlicher, als dass da die E12 bei gleichem Durchmesser ganze 8 mm kürzer als die E11 ist. 8 mm sind an sich nicht viel, aber für eine Lampe, die man jeden Tag in Hosen- oder Anzugstaschen mit sich herum trägt, sind 8 mm recht viel und auch bemerkbar.
Die drei Leuchtstufen der E12 lassen sich bequem durch kurzes und wiederholtes Drücken auf den Schalter anwählen. Alternativ kann man auch mehrmals kurz am Lampenkopf drehen. Beim Einschalten hat man immer die niedrigste Stufe. Dieselangt auch für den normalen Gebrauch. Die drei Leuchtstufen sind aber auch Geschmackssache. Mir persönlich hätten die 2 Stufen der E11 (sehr schwach und voll Power) gelangt. Mit voller Leistung hat man wirklich viel Licht zur Verfügung und kann in dunklen Räumen für soviel Licht sorgen, dass man bequem Sachen findet, sich bestens orientieren kann und kein weiteres Licht mehr benötigt.
Die verbaute LED ist schön mittig in den Reflektor eingesetzt und der Spot ist sehr homogen.

Jetzt zu den Punkten, die mich dazu bewogen haben, nur 4 Sterne zu geben.
- Als erstes wäre das die verkratzte Linse - kann mal passieren, ist aber nicht schön. Da so eine Lampe mit knapp 27€ schon sehr teuer ist, sollte sowas nicht sein. Meine 3 Jahre alte und täglich in Benutzung befindliche E11 hat nicht einen Kratzer auf der Linse.
- Der Schalter ist nur ein Schalter und kann nicht als Taster verwendet werden.
- Der Rückversatz der Linse ist kleiner als bei der E11. Dort war die Linse durch einen etwas größeren Rückversatz bestens geschützt. Wie sich das beim täglichen Tragen in der Hosentasche letztendlich auswirkt, werde ich testen.

Alles in allem aber eine gute und funktionelle kleine LED-Taschenlampe mit viel Leuchtkraft oder langer Ausdauer.",germany,"January 23, 2015","Lecker, Licht und Lesen",4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:48:07.360697,2020-11-12 11:48:07.529756,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

298,R21TJD6KYU8A90,True,There's NO excuse not to own one!!!,"I probably own about eight of these little e12 lights. Not because I'm a flashaholic or anything I just can't see at night or very well in low light. One resides in my pocket at all times, another in the truck, another in my gear, another in the kitchen, another in the bathroom, etc etc etc. I also live out in the country. No not on the edge of street light lit City streets just outside of ""town"" but a couple miles outside of town. I've got skunks, possums, and had chickens (ever deal with a possum or skunk in the hen house at night?). Night comes and it gets dark around my place. Are you starting to see good quality flashlights are kind of important to me?

Now for penis envy and bragging to some but a declaration of facts. I probably own a dozen surefire lights, half a dozen lapg lights, and countless others including cmg, maglite, etc so I think I have a fair bit of experience with different lights to provide a broad spectrum to color or illuminate my opinions. Yes a poor pun intended.
The Fenix e12 doesn't begin to compare to my surefire p2x fury at 600 lumens but it's also not that kind of light. This is the type of light that you have with you ALL the time no matter who you are, walk off life, occupation, or financial capability. This is the type of light that will allow you to safely navigate blacked out buildings, walk down the trail that last few miles at night, provide just enough light to walk by and with a couple taps provide enough light to ID something 50 yards away, or even illuminate the inside of that porta-potty at an event to make sure it's ""safe"" to sit down. This is the type of light that you can keep fed anywhere with some imagination. This is the type of light you can hold in your mouth while working on your car or changing a tire at night with ease. Etc...
I find it's beam to be acceptable to my eyes for peripheral illumination as well as focused enough to give me a decent bright spot 50 yards out to my back fence line and into the field behind my house a bit.
I have had it turn on in my pocket a few times on accident because of pocket knife, change, etc pushed the button when I sat down. You feel the warmth after awhile. It does get warm. Even with that happening say twice a year I rarely have to change my battery and I use this light every night and even during the day in low light situations. The worse that's happened so far is having a battery discharge enough to not power the high setting but give me a second medium setting. I find medium good for general distance around the yard even though I prefer high.
I'm trying to think of anything else.... Oh yes the lanyard after a year of being in my pocket is starting to fray near where it goes thru the light. When it breaks I'll replace it with some spider wire or a stainless steel split ring.
In summation of my ramblings....
At $25-26 this is NOT a very expensive flashlight, however it's anything but ""cheap"" where quality for the money is concerned. There is no reason why any thinking person can't afford one. You spend more a week for cable television, cell phones, alcohol, drugs, fast food, tobacco, etc. Hell some of us probly spent more money in a week on condoms when we were younger!!!! LMFAO
When you need a light it's going to be with you because it's a convenient size to carry without being obtrusive.
It's suitably bright for signaling purposes and at night that lost hiker or hunter etc is going to stand out if the light flashes at searchers.
After at least a year in my pocket with knives, change, who knows what all it's still not missing a beat.
I'm a huge fan of everyday carry and am one of those guys who was WAY before it became cool and this light is perfect for it.
One other note while probably not waterproof I have used mine in water to about eight feet many times for a half hour to hour at depth with zero leakage. My kids love it when I turn it on and throw it in the deep end of the pool for a pool light or something to dive for at night. No I don't suggest diving with it, but I'd call it Wx proof enough for my needs.
I have purchased all my lights myself but for a surefire e1b that was a gift from a friend. Never has a business or manufacturer given me a light for review. I have received no compensation for my review.
I simply want to show people how easy and affordable it can be to have a few EDC items that can make a huge difference.

So with all the money I've spent on flashlights over the years my advice to my own family and what I've done for my own kids and family and friends is bought them e12's out of my own pocket and I advise everyone to avoid cheaper priced lights that ""are just as good"" some would claim and just buy an e12!

If Fenix ever reads reviews and listens to their customers there is one HUGE NEGATIVE to this light. It lacks a simple reversible pocket clip. It MUST be reversible. CMG had a simple one one their Ultra Infinity task light. Lapg has a very functional one on their EDC light. Surefire has a great pocket clip that reverses wonderfully for me, and all these allow me to headlight their lights. Fenix has..... Well I guess Fenix has me left waiting.....

If you find my review helpful or junk please use the voting options so Amazon can weed out worthless reviews that serve little to no purpose. Thanks!

I will also update my review should my feelings change due to light failure etc.

300,RIQVK78X1ZIVU,True,"Small, bright AA flashlight - great for EDC","I discovered the Fenix E12 while searching for a small AA flashlight for everyday carry. Most of the flashlights I own are reasonably compact but still too bulky for EDC; I wanted something small enough that I could forget it was in my pocket. At just under 3.5” long and two ounces with battery, the E12 is exactly that.

Don’t let its diminutive size fool you, the E12 is well built and feels sturdy in hand. It has a knurled texture, which is customary of Fenix lights, and a recessed tail switch that not only allows it to tail stand but makes accidentally turning it on almost impossible. A pocket clip isn’t included but you can attach a key ring.

There are three brightness settings of 8, 50 and 130 lumens which you can cycle through by half-pressing the power button. 8 is perfect for navigating a small room or confined space, 50 is sufficient for most outdoor tasks, and 130 will brightly illuminate anything within 150 feet. Although bright, the beam is a little on the narrow side. I’ve included beam shots with my review photos but keep in mind the light is noticeably brighter in person than it appears in the photos.

There is no mode memory, so when you turn it on it’ll always start out at the lowest brightness setting. This has turned out to be a really handy feature because the brighter settings could potentially be jarring in certain environments. It’s quick and easy to increase brightness if you need to.

Ultimately, the E12 is a very well rounded flashlight. I really like mine and see myself getting a lot of use out of it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small, bright AA flashlight granted the lack of pocket clip and mode memory aren’t deal breakers.",the united states,"October 2, 2015",H.

302,R1T90Y3XBOXNLZ,True,Perfect pocket flashlight,"Prefect pocket light. This flashlight disappears into the pocket just like a bic lighter that's the same size.

It's easy to cycle through the brightness levels with the tailcap switch. I mostly use it at the lowest setting so I can see without blowing out my vision. But you do have 2 brighter levels if you need tolight up a room. A really good feature is the flat tailcap whick allows you to tailstand it and light a room up like a candle.

AA batteries are widely available and you can always rotate rechargeables if you have wired or solar power available. These are mypreferable batteries for an edc pocket light.

Not much to say about durability. Maglight set the bar 40 years ago with aluminum tube flashlights. They only get better and better every year. As is typical for lights of this type, it's an aluminum tube with o rings sealing the tail cap and the light head. It's one smooth bar of aluminum with the same circumference along the full length. It's pretty hard to break any of these lights and you can run them over or take them to thebottom of theocean.

303,R1DAOLYYBXR9L7,True,All you need made tiny and solid. AA power!,"For those of you who are debating whether or not to spend this amount of money on something as simple as a flashlight, I can say the product really does reflect its price tag. It'll probably be my only flashlight for years. This isn't a spotlight, but it's still plenty bright for most jobs. I've used this flashlight for computer and car work and the low brightness setting is such a godsend. Most of the time I only need the low setting to see what I'm working on without the harsh glare of a super strong beam. The higher settings are decently bright and more than I require. The fact that this little flashlight is powered by a single AA is probably its single best selling point for me because I have an excess of rechargeable AA's. The battery contacts seem to be gold-plated so I don't ever have to worry about the typical oxidation causing the light to flicker when moved around due to poor electrical connectivity. I've owned an Ultrafire and Cree flashlight but I have to regularly clean the contacts every two or so months to get a reliable light.

304,R25NADWNFVJPZR,True,Great flashlight at a very good price - but will it meet your needs,"The Fenix E12 is a great flashlight for the price.
Size: doesn't quite disappear inside a med. size male hand. Fits nicely in a man’s pants pocket in general. I could see it being a little large for small or tight pockets. (4.5/5)
Grip/Handling: knurling on body gives a good positive grip but could be a little more aggressive. On the positive side it has enough grip without making it difficult to remove the light from a pocket. It also comes with a reasonably sized lanyard that I use due to my lack of dexterity (4.5/5)
Construction: the body feels solid and heavy for its size. The lens is clear and appears substantial enough. The black finish on the body is holding up well to wear without aa scratch. The lens bevel has acquired two chips in the paint. I may have dropped it. The light opens easy and has an o-ring seal to keep moisture at bay. I have not testing its water resistance. Living on the coast, humidity is a big factor in killing my flashlights so time will tell. So far so good (4.5/5)
Ease of use: One button with three modes. Always starts at the lowest setting and increases to mid setting with press, high setting with next, and then back to low with next press and so on. The switch seems to hit the right mark on sensitivity. After several months of use it has never come on in my pocket (I carry it with me 24/7) and has always worked when pressed. The switch gives good physical feedback when engaged. It requires a surprising light touch too work. Again, really good balance here (5/5)
Power: One AA. Cheap and easy. After 3 months I had to replace the factory battery . I will chock that up to the factory battery for now. I dropped in a new Duracell and have run the light several times a day, usually on low but not all the time and it is still as strong as the day I changed the battery. If that changes I'll update this review. (5/5)
Value: I am pretty cheap so when I buy an item like this I really consider value for dollar. To this point it has done everything I purchased it for, an always on hand flashlight that provides adequate light for 80 - 90% of what I use a flashlight for and it must be reliable. That being said it has met all my expectations so far and at a fair price point of $25. (5/5)
Overall: I selected this light initially because my wife needed a small but reliable light to carry with her daily. In the process of doing my research my “cheap” flashlight started getting temperamental so I bought two flashlights. Glad I did because the Fenix E12 to date has functioned flawlessly and held up well to daily use. It is not going set to things on fire with 10,000 lumens but for everyday life it works great. With three light levels and easy handling it does what I need without any hassle. I would purchase this product and recommend it to others.(5/5)",the united states,"December 21, 2016",C.D.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:48:18.254913,2020-11-12 11:48:18.423198,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

305,R3KCCXZ6BXP0VO,True,The quintessential single AA EDC pocket light.,"I love AA flashlights. It is such a common and abundant cell that you can acquire virtually at any store. In the event of an emergency, it's a guarantee that I will have AAs on hand and ready to go. If not, well then I'll empty a few electronics remotes and I'll be ready. If I did have to venture out to a store, it's quite likely I'll find them there as well.

That was my mind set when I bought my 2x AA Fenix E25 and the same idea with my new 1x AA E12. While the E25 is more a medium sized light, the E12 is more EDC sized and ready for pocket duty with it's size roughly on par with a tube of Chapstick, or a Bic lighter, just a bit taller. Even being such a small light, it doesn't feel cheap or delicate in anyway. In fact, it is both impact and water resistant to an extent, so it's not indestructible...but pretty close.

The modes are nicely spaced: 8 lumen low, 50 lumen medium and 130 lumen high. The beam is a good mix of flood and throw and provides useful light from a small package. Compared to my E25, it doesn't have that tight, super bright hot spot enclosed in a broad floody beam, rather a simple even beam of light. It's no thrower, but given it's size it provides pretty balanced illumination for a variety of tasks. Whether it's a quick trip to take the trash out, a dog walk or taking a look in your yard - the E12 works, and serves a simple, conveniently sized light to ride in your pocket, backpack or glovebox.

The user interface is decidedly basic. A full click turns the light on to low mode. A light tap brings you to medium, another tap to high. Full click again to turn off. Easy and effective for one handed use. There's no mode memory, so it always starts on low. The low-medium-high sequence is a plus as well, I don't know why it would be any other way. No momentary on either, but features like that, memory and 5 different types of strobe aren't always necessary to me. It's a no frills light, but sometimes less is more.

What I like about the E-series from Fenix is the durability and simplicity. Sometimes, you just need a dependable light that you can count on to work. The E12 is no different and based on the countless positive reviews, I think it will be riding in my pockets for many years to come.

Overall, it is a great pocket light that is small enough to take anywhere with decent output.

*** 2 year update ***

I've had the E12 for 2 years now so I figured I'd update this one last time with some final thoughts. The light has been utterly reliably for the entire time I've owned it. It has survived many hikes and camping trips as well as holding up fine to numerous drops and exposure to rain/water. Still an excellent choice for a small single AA flashlight.

306,R70NRNHGLES,True,"Fantastic light - small, light, and great tail cap switch!","I have numerous flashlights that I use regularly. I have larger ones that I use outdoors, but I wanted something smaller that I could carry in my pocket. Primarily I wanted something that could help my old eyes read a menu in a dark restaurant without blinding everyone else nearby. This light is the perfect solution.

What is fantastic about this light:
1) Perfect size and weight. Not much bigger than the AA battery. Very light weight.
2) The tail cap switch is perfection and won't activate accidentally
3) Full press to turn light on and a light press to cycle between brightness levels
4) The light always comes on in low mode (no memory) and cycles low-medium-high
5) Comes with a nice lanyard
6) No sharp corners or edges. This is a pocket flashlight not a defensive tool.
7) Good battery life (40 hours on low!) and a useful amount of light on high
8) It doesn't get hot when its on

What I don't like ... I haven't really found anything yet. Again, my primary desire was something I could use in a dark room (like reading a menu) without blinding everyone around me.

307,R12IU3OPK15DNS,True,機能性に特に問題は無いが。,"気になることが3つあります。
1は運が悪かっただけで、2と3は購入者との相性の問題なので、どれも本製品E12というモデルの本質的な問題点という訳ではありません。

１．私の手元に届いた製品は、メーカーロゴとモデル名「FENIX E12」の文字がほとんど消えかかっていてがっかり。

正確に言うと、白い文字は黒の本体に直接書いてもノリが悪いからというためか、下地塗装として灰色で文字が書いてあり、その上に白い塗料が塗ってあるということなのだろうが、私の手元に届いた製品では、灰色の文字はしっかり書かれているが、その上に塗ってあるべき白い塗装がほとんど塗られていなく、汚い感じで疎らに1/3程しか塗られていない。
プリントミス感が感じられる。それともこういうデザインなのだろうか。

２．E12ではなくE11の後期版には、付属品にラバースイッチカバーがついてくるようだが、本製品の付属品は電池といわゆるストラップとOリングのみ。

E11より本製品の方がテールスイッチを押す機会は断然増えるはずで、ラバースイッチカバーの替えが付いていないという訳は無いだろうと勝手に期待していたので少しだけがっかり。
本製品の説明書にもアクセサリーの欄にランヤード、スペアOリングとしか記載されていないので、ミスで付属されていなかったということではない。

また、ラバースイッチカバーの柄がE11とは違い、ロゴマーク等は無く単純な格子状。
もしかして、柄を変えたから耐久性が上がったことにより替えを付属させなくなった、ということなのか？？？

３．操作、機能面について

本製品のハイモードは130ルーメンとのことだが、家電量販店で1700円程で購入できる某メーカーの110ルーメンに比べて体感的に、光が弱いと感じる。

光を3段階の強さに選択できる。ヘッドを素早く操作すると切り替えできたり、テールスイッチを半押しすると切り替えできる。
必ずローから点灯し、メモリー機能は無いはず。

私がE11ではなく本製品を購入した理由は、ハイのときの明るさが110ルーメン以上であることとローのときに10ルーメン以下であるから。
とはいえ、それと引き換えに、間欠点灯や、なんと言ってもヘッドの回転だけでハイとローを切り替えでき、そのまま物理的にメモリーできるというE11に備わっている機能が無いことは残念。

私の勝手な理想としては、ヘッドの緩め具合で3段階の光を物理的にメモリーできる、という製品があったらいいなと思う。

追記

一年近く使用しての感想です。
散歩時にハイモード常時使用を目的として購入しました。
しかし、あまりその機会はあまりありませんでした。(ライトのせいではなく持ち主のせい)
ちょこちょことローモードで机周りで使用したり、散歩をしても殆どをローやミドルで使用していました。

で、最近はようやくハイモードの割合が多い散歩をしたのですが、そこで思いました。
あれ？電池切れるの早いな。もしかして動作不安定なのか？と。
説明書にはハイモードはニッケル水素だと1時間30分持つと書いてあるという頭があったので、そう思いました。
しかし、説明書をよくよく見るとニッケル水素はニッケル水素でも2500mAhのものを使用時だそうです。
私は1900mAhを使用しています。
だから説明書よりランタイムが短いのだと気づきました。

そこで極めて簡易的な私的な実験をしてみました。
手持ちの満充電1900mAhエネループを入れてどれぐらいハイモードが機能しているのか。
結果は、今ハイモードだろうな、と思えるのは40分間ぐらいで、それ以後はミドルモードとほとんど違いを感じない。
1時間を過ぎるとミドルモードより明らかに暗くなるが、まだ光の強さを切り替える操作をしても消えてしまわない。
1時間10分後にはローモードレベルになり、光の強さを切り替える操作をしてみたらそのまま点かなくなった。

ということで問題の無い製品だと確かめることができました。

追記2
購入してから一年数ヶ月使用してみての感想です。
主に舗装道や丘陵地帯の未舗装道のウォーキング（一部、ジョギング）で使用しています。

テールボタン式であること、それを半押しで三段階に光量が調節できること、そして小さいところ、この三点が思いのほか実用極まりないと感じています。

まず、テールボタンに最初は抵抗がありました。
しかし、ライトというものは目線に近づけて使用しないと、影がたくさんできてしまい、視界が悪くなります。
そこで目線に近づけるように高い位置でライトを持つ（人差指と薬指に挟む）ので、やはりテールボタンが操作しやすいです。
そういった操作では、当該ライトは半押し三段階なので、瞬時に目的の光量に切り替えでき、さらにコンパクトな本体のおかげで、ストレスがありません。
また、ハイモードであってもナイトウォーキングに2回程使用したら、ライトに目が慣れて、ライトの光による照り返しによる不快感（チカチカ、くらみ、頭痛）を感じなくなりました。ハイモードが130ルーメンというのもそういった意味で丁度良いのかもしれません。より強いモードがあると結局それで運用してしまうのがオチだと考えると、果たしてその強さでも目が慣れるのかという疑問が残るので。
そう考えると2015年9月現在では、たしかに当該ライトよりも高いルーメン数の単三電池一本のライトがいくつか出てきていますが、一番万能なのは当該ライトかもしれません。
イーグルタックでは200ルーメンオーバー、ゼブラライトではターボで500オーバー、ハイモードで300オーバーとありますが、コンパクトさでもそれらのライトは当該ライトより劣るようです。

以上のことから、現在でも上述のような感覚の使い方であれば当該ライトは未だに良い選択肢なのではないかと思いました。

追記3
(2018年10月)

やはりこのライトは素晴らしい。
実は、ゼブラライトの最新モデルSC5c mk2　1AA CRI:93-95 を購入しました。
そのライトはごつごつしています。
一方、当該製品は、裸でポケットに入れて置けるぐらい突起がない。
かといい、手から滑り落ちる訳でもない。
配光も、これ一本で本当にオールマイティーだとわかった。
当該ライトは130ルーメンで、SC5c　mk2は400ルーメンオーバーなのに、当該ライトの方が見やすい。
結局、手前ばかりが明るくなる配光だと、わずかに先が真っ暗に見えてしまう。
当該ライトだと、これ一本でも里山のナイトランができる。
近所の散歩だってできる。
見通しの良いところ照らして、光をふりまわす楽しさだって感じられる。
レンズが硝子ではないから、割る心配も低い。
最高のＥＤＣライトを探していたけど、既に持っていたとは。

このままのシステム、このままの形で、バージョンアップは起こらないのだろうか。

追記4
(2018.10.10)

うん、もうね、どこのライトだかは言いませんが、単三一本で1万円以上するライト、ターボではなくハイモードでも、発熱がえぐい。
30分つけてたら、1分触ったらやけどするのでは？というレベル。ターボだと自動で光が弱くなるという仕組みになっているものの、発熱がえぐすぎて、触ったとたんにやけどするかと思った。点灯から3分でそんなレベル。
一方！！！
当該製品(フェニックス)は、そんなことになったためしがない。
ハイモードで多少熱はもつけれども、危険を感じるほどではない。
やっぱり、ＦＥＮＩＸってすごい。
信頼性、安全性は、ダントツと思いました。
やはり1ＡＡモデルで当該製品にかなうライトは無いのでは？と今でも思います。
再三になってしまいますが、バージョンアップしたモデルはいつ頃に発売されるのかな。それが楽しみで仕方ないです。

操作とストラップ穴が秀逸。

まずは操作について。
必ずLOWから点灯のLOW→MID→HI→LOW・・・・
これは皆さまも同じ認識だろう。

しかしそれだけではない。
MIDからHIを介さずにLOWに行くことができる。
つまり、MIDよりまぶしい状況にならずにLOWに行くことができる。
すばらしい。
操作は簡単。
半押しを気持ち長くやってやればよい。
ああなんて幸せ。

次にストラップ穴について。
テールボタンだからストラップ穴ができるだけ尻側に近いところにあるほうが、取り回しが良いということはストラップを着用して使用するタイプの人にはよく知られている事実だと思う。

そんななか、当該製品はまさにお尻側についている。
ただ、当該製品と違って、一つしか穴がなかったりすると微妙な結果となることが。
というのも、テールスタンドのできるデザインになっているのに、一つしか穴がない場合、ストラップの紐が邪魔になり、テースルタンドができなかったり、安定しなかったり、または、かろうじてストラップ紐をいちいちずらせばなんとかテールスタンドができるという具合になってしまう。

一方、当該製品は、2つの穴を使用して、テール側にストラップ紐が回らないようにストラップを本体に取り付けることができる。
こうすることでテールスタンドをする際に、邪魔にならない。いちいち、紐をずらす必要はなくなる。

こんなにすらばらしいライトはほかにはないのではないだろうか。",japan,"June 5, 2014",山田太郎,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:48:18.827118,2020-11-12 11:48:19.075454,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

308,R1LYFVG4WRSZAQ,True,One of my favorite lights. Superb light to carry all the time.,"I am a ""Flashaholic"" and professional user of lights. I have used lights professionally for over 20 years of my life in Fire/EMS and Law Enforcement. I have used lights for diving, mountain biking, kayaking, hiking, backpacking, camping, personal protection, emergency preparedness, and general use. I have lights that cost over $600.

This light has become one of my favorite lights and is my personal choice for an EDC (Every Day Carry). It is small enough to carry in my pocket at all times. It uses the commonly available AA battery. It can use rechargeable AA NiMH Batteries, Lithium disposable, or if you must the alkaline battery. I really like the fact that it always comes on in low mode. It has 3 very intelligent levels of output with good runtimes. It is very water resistant. It can be used with the tail switch or by turning the head for on/off and mode selection. It seems to be rugged and reliable. The beam qualities are quite good for a light of this price. It has a very good combination of reach and spill.

Buy one of these for every member of your family. Use quality NiMH rechargeable batteries. Have high quality disposable lithium batteries for cold and hot weather performance.",the united states,"February 4, 2020",Stephen W.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:48:19.093406,2020-11-12 11:48:19.458456,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

309,RVFJ7V3MG24DU,True,There are better options,"After a few days my initial impression is this guy is rather inferior to my surefires and my EDC streamlight microstream. The output seems about as advertised and the focus is similar to the surefire with most going to the center and nice quick bleed to the sides. The issue is the 3 levels output which is completely unnecessary, cumbersome and can cause major confusion. Also by starting on the lowest level it removes almost any tactical use. Then there is the completely round body which completely removes the ability to lay it on its side unless you're ok with it constantly rolling away from you. The only pro I can see it he guarded button which likely would prevent accidental activation. I would be interested in seeing how it handles low battery situations (get dim or just cut out like the streamlight) but I'm seriously considering just returning it.",the united states,"May 31, 2019",James,3.0,0,2020-11-12 11:48:19.466947,2020-11-12 11:48:19.753692,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

310,R30VA8V2VJZ4GF,True,"Pretty nice light, not quite a bright enough EDC though.","Three modes, low, medium, and high, in that order. Nice TIR lens. Does not remember the setting between power cycles, always starts at low. Includes lanyard. Will tailstand. Would be nice if it included a keyring, although it is a bit fat to use as a keychain light, like the E01 or E05, or oLight i3e (very nice copper light, though only one brightness level)

It appears to use CC and not PWM so you don't see flicker at lower light levels.

311,R1G0RZVXCQ0PVE,True,After 4 Years I still love this light,"I had a Fenix E11 for a few years before this and liked it a lot. Unfortunately I lost it, so immediately replaced the light with an E12. Nice upgrade. In 2016 this was the brightest best deal I could find with good ratings. Now there are brighter small lights if you need it. Be sure to note that this light turns on with just 8 lumens. Press the power button lightly and it bumps up to 50 lumens which is Much brighter. With one more gentle press the light puts out 120 lumens, very bright to me. I have a small holster I purchased separately for my belt, so the light is always with me. I use Everedy Lithium batteries and get about 18 months of daily use. It is easy to tell when the battery is low because the difference between medium and brightest setting is small, but the light still works pretty good with a low battery. I used to carry a 2 AA cell Mag Light, this is much smaller, much brighter, batteries last a long time. Mag missed the boat when LEDs became viable.

312,R8R76K4LGLOTC,True,Stunningly Mediocre,"Priced well above, and rated, well above the competition, it fails on several counts. First -- price. Really -- did you expect me to pay $20 US for a simple LED flashlight. I fell for it. For half the price, one might expect a light powered by an AAA, with decent lumens. Why would I carry an AA battery and light if it was not superior?

The button-press 3-stage light takes a little getting used to. Not a simple, or discoverable, UI. The tiny holes for the lanyard (included) have no simple illustration, and the narrow string hard to insert. There is no simple ring, and it thus fails as a keychain light (which I was replacing).

If you don't use your phone, you want something bright, and not something you have to carefully press 3 times. You want something small, and you want something simple. This will do until it self-destructs (like it's predecessor [unnamed]). Want something this big? make the loops bigger, throw in a ring, make something that is easy to put out of your pocket and shine quickly on your target.

313,ROBG1TLO1YLRF,True,... 3 years ago for my everyday carry and i loved it. I lost it walking the dog a ...,"I bought this flashlight about 3 years ago for my everyday carry and i loved it. I lost it walking the dog a few weeks ago and picked up a replacement the second i could and i figured this time around i should leave a review. This little powerhouse runs on a single AA battery, has three settings (High, Med, Low), is water resistant and compact. It comes with a lanyard that fell off after a few weeks, a AA battery, and a manual. The thing is pretty straightforward and sleek. I've never been a fan of the tactical sharp edgy design that seems to flood the market of powerful pocket flashlights. it sits in your pocket without much fuss like a roll of quarters, but i will say that after a few years of wear the harder edges of the button side might open a hole in your pocket. It can put out around a 130 Lumens on High with a single battery, which makes it easy to forage batteries for during the apocalypse or when you're broke. My only complaint would be that there was no option for a clip or anything and the lanyard punked out too quickly. And I will lastly add that when i got my replacement that it was identical except the settings cycled Low, Med, High and that was a huge upgrade in my opinion.

314,R3M4B46YOEX3Y0,True,My new everyday carry favorite.,"I use my EDC light a lot for working on equipment and for walking around our wooded property at night. I had been using a StreamLight Stylus Pro as my EDC pocket light. I really like the Stylus Pro a lot, it's plenty bright and very thin, not much bigger than a pen, but there were a couple of things about it I didn't like. I found myself using an cheap single AA flashlight at night because most of the time I didn't really want a ""torch"" just to see where I was going and avoid tripping over a dog. Sometimes you just don't want to attract a lot of attention by using a super bright light, and there are times when reflections can be annoying, especially indoors.

My cheap flashlight was starting to give out and I was just going to get another when I thought I'd look on Amazon to see what they had and I'm very glad I did. I wasn't planning on spending much for a new flashlight, but when I saw the features of the E12, I had to try it. Now that I've used it for a week, I absolutely love it. The low setting is perfect for getting around at night, inside or out. I really like the way the tail switch works, turning on and off on the low setting and easily bumping up to the bright and super bright modes when you need them. I also very much like the partially guarded switch, which I think is much better than the fully exposed tail switch on the Stylus Pro. The E12 is a good bit brighter, whiter and has a larger lighted area than the Stylus Pro, which tends to be bit yellowish. I'll still use my Stylus Pro during the day at work, but this is the light that will be with me the rest of the time.

Update: Unfortunately, I must agree with the reviewer that lamented for a glass lens and knock off a star. The lens on this light is loosing the battle with all the other pocket stuff and is quickly becoming scratched up. The lens is almost flush with the end of the light so it has little protection and is very susceptible to getting scratched. I was hoping that I could replace the lens, but this light was not made to be taken apart. As a result, I've had to resort to using a holster, kind of like putting a clunky case on your svelte smart phone.

315,R1UV7ZJKIL5S6V,True,New EDC choice! Edit: For now...,"I’m not a “flashaholic,” but my wife is a cop and I’m a farmer. We use our stuff and have to know it well!
I got sick of losing my tiny Olights(See pic). This is my first Fenix. I have multiples of all the other reputable brands(except streamlight), and this is of corse on par!
Pros:
•USES A AA RATHER THAN THE LESS THAN HALF POWER AAA(which typically costs the same per each!)
•Nice tail switch.
•Perfect size for carry and use in daytime situations.
•Projector lens helps attain excellent “throw!”
Cons:
•No memory(start at low every time).
•130 lumens isn’t exactly amazing: However, it’s just fine with the narrowly focused beam.
•If you’re in need of flood, look elsewhere!

If it sounds like it fits your needs, but it!

Edit: I decided to replace my wife’s backup flashlight. So I bought one from another brand that I’m not familiar with. It came with a micro USB chargeable lithium ion 14500 battery. It is the exact same size. It costs two dollars less(even with the battery included). It comes with two tail caps. One is a twisty magnetic which shortens and allows placement on steel.

316,R2DBHUNW2866T6,True,"Small, very bright, 1x AA, but with reservations...","I work in a job that requires that I have a flashlight on hand. I have been using Fenix flashlights for some time. They are small and very bright.
I do wish companies wouldn't feel the need to 'upgrade' their products. This piece has three intensities, so turning it on puts you in low mode and you then have to switch to a higher one if desired. I want a light that turns on and off, like the E11 I had previously that I can no longer buy. Unfortunately, it died right after the 2 year warranty ended- funny how that happens.
These are a little smaller than the E11. I have seen mentioned before, it can be confusing to feel which end is which, though with time I expect I will get used to that as the switch end has raised sides.
I like that they take a single AA battery. I have a large stash of good used AAs available, so I am never at a loss for batteries.
Now, if they only didn't turn on to low mode. I can see how the different intensities could come in handy. I guess I will have to get used to turning it up as I turn it on...

Add: I have had this in my pocket for a long time since I wrote that. I'm glad it starts in low mode- it's plenty bright, and batteries last ages. If I need it brighter, there are two more settings. I think I thought I would have to cycle through them when I first got it. You don't- on/off in low mode, brighter if you want it.

This is not really a tactical flashlight, but that is okay for certain of my uses around the house. I actually like that this unit defaults to low power, which you then need to up-cycle to higher power settings if desired. Great for using when you wake up in the middle of the night, but don't want to fully awaken to 10 million candlepower!

It also has these features I like/expect in a flashlight: excellent water-proofing, recessed tail switch, and you can stand it up in a ""lantern"" mode.

This flashlight runs for a nice, long time on low power, and uses up all of an AA. At the ""dead"" point, alkalines read about 0.4 - 0.5V open-circuit. That's pretty impressive. I intend to use lithium AA's once I finish off the factory alkalines (lithiums have higher energy density, are relatively insensitive to cold/heat, and don't leak, unlike alkalines).

318,R14DI5F9BX0MCV,True,Thoroughly recommended to anyone,"The E12 has proven to be an outstanding multi-purpose flashlight. I know that it's popular with the EDC (everyday carry) crowd, but even if you aren't into that you will be pleased with it. I ended up buying several: one for the glovebox of my car, one for my toolbox, and another for around-the-house tasks.

There is certainly no shortage of rugged LED flashlights these days, but the E12 has been a winner in my book for a few reasons. First, it uses a single AA battery. A lot of these ultra-bright ones that are best-sellers on Amazon need a lithium battery that costs $10 or more. No way am I throwing that kind of money away on batteries for a flashlight that only gets occasional use. Another reason I'm loving the E12 is because of the size. It's small enough to hold in the palm of your hand without feeling like you'll misplace it or drop it, yet can also be maneuvered into tight spaces like the engine bay of a car or behind furniture. The third reason I bought a few of these is that they're able to take a lot of punishment. The one in my toolbox has been dropped onto concrete repeatedly, smacked against objects in my car's engine bay, and has suffered some accidental blows from my wrenches and hammer -- and it just keeps on ticking.

The E12 has three brightness modes but I rarely find myself using anything other than the dimmest setting. If anything, the highest setting is only for use in very dark environments such as a forest in the dead of night. I tried using the brightest setting while working on my car and found it to be overpowering: it simply reflected off everything and made me squint.

For the price paid I think it's really hard to beat this. It fits just about anywhere and uses cheap/readily available batteries. It'll take abuse without any issues and I won't cry if it does break (since it was only about $20). I can't bring myself to spend $100 on some of these fancier ones when you can get 95% of the performance and quality for so much less.",the united states,"July 2, 2016",dparm,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:48:26.480830,2020-11-12 11:48:26.959381,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

321,R2TUWPHY5KE3EO,True,"Owned for 5 years, the best light for my purposes","I own numerous flashlights for numerous applications.
My applications for this light numbered from most frequent to least: 1) Walking my dog before sunrise and at night to look out for people, poop, varmints and a signal for cars so they don't hit us. 2) I work in an animal facility that occasionally require nightly health checks. 3) Random day to day situations that require a light.

So I bought this light when I was looking for a small single AA powered light that I can easily carry everyday. I chose this light for its three levels of brightness. I bought this light before I truly knew what I wanted for an EDC light and I got lucky.

Modification and uses for modification:
To make the light more useful to me I added a paracord tassel to the button end of the light as pictured. This is easy to make and actually fun to make as well you can google a tutorial. The tassel allows for many uses: 1) Allows me to hook the tassel into the collar of my shirt so I can free my hand when needed such as when I am walking my dog and need to pick up my dog's poops. 2) Helps prevent the light from rolling on slanted surfaces. 3) allows a more ergonomic way to shine the light and manipulate the button at the same time, as pictured. Holding the light this way while using it also frees up my pinky finger to hook my pepper spray with the provided keyring, as pictured, making the pepper spray easier to access when needed.

Brightness settings/light pattern
The three settings make the light very useful because you don't always need a bright light. Using a dim light when needed also saves on battery life. I use the dim light when I wake up in the early morning and need to look for something and I dont want to wake my fiancé. The brightest setting has a very far throw distance which is also contributed by the light pattern. This light uses a spot light pattern as oppose to a flood pattern. I really like this compromise because this allows the battery to last longer for its size and I rather have a far reach than a wide light pattern. This is an important tradeoff to note for all who read this.

Light activation: So keep in mind this isn't really a tactical light. There is no momentary button but be honest with yourself when you determine your needs for an everyday carry light. This may not be the best light for you if you need something for tactical purposes. its not like the click of the light button is loud either. That being said the activation of this light is very easy for its intended design.

EDC:
Unless I forget to put this light in my pocket, this light goes with me everywhere. The size is so small it doesnt bother me in any way. On weekends I will carry the light with my multitool inside a handgun magazine carrier made by Remora I have repurposed. they fit together perfectly and the whole package fits in my back pocket nicely. I have a boney butt but it doesnt bother me sitting down all day with this package in my back pocket. The tassel also makes it easy to pull out the light from the magazine carrier.

Battery life:
The battery life on this is very good. I use this light every day at least once when I take my dog out in the early mornings and I use it at the second brightness setting. Each time I'll run the light for about 5-15mins. I will usually replace the battery after a little over a month. The light will start to malfunction when the battery will start to die. You will not be able to use the brightest setting or the second brightest settings when the battery starts to die. Another advantage is the battery is very common and easy to find.

So I've had this specific light for about 5 years now. I like it so much, I've bought one for my dad, my sister, my fiancé, and future father in law. The cost may seem high but I think you get a lot for the money so to me the price is fair.

So overall I highly recommend this light if you need a good general purpose light that is compact.",the united states,"June 4, 2020",Jesse N.,5.0,0,2020-11-12 11:48:33.736201,2020-11-12 11:48:33.860893,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

322,R2QABFTYO327ZQ,True,Buy this light first!,"This is a fabulous light. On high (130 lumens)
the light is powerful enough to momentarily blind someone in the dark. I believe this happens above 100 lumens. The beam is narrow and right up front allowing plenty of side lighting. It tail stands well and has a hole for a lanyard. (The only way you won't lose it or misplace it.) The 3 setting allow the light to run for 1 hr at 130 lumens, 3.5hrs at 50 and 22hrs at 8 lumens on an alkaline AA. With a Ni-MH battery mid goes to 6.5hrs and an incredible 40 hrs at 8 lumens.
This means the light can run for 4 or 5 nights on low! Great night light for vacation or when your kid moves into the dorm. The 8 lumens is perfect for camping or a in a strange place like a motel!
I have illuminated 3 large rooms for hrs at 8 lumens with 5 lights. My mom is on oxygen and can't be without it. The Fenix 12 lights up a room well enough to change oxygen bottles or to read under.

323,R3NOSEFESRTLNP,True,Just Buy It!,"There was a time when a 100-lumen flashlight was considered bright. My first LED flashlight was a single-mode Surefire 65 lumen model that set me back sixty bucks, burned 45-50 minutes and took an expensive CR123A battery 🔋 that cost five bucks at a drugstore (if you needed it in a hurry). I spent thirty bucks on a flash head that upgraded it to 100 lumens. Now, thanks to technology, serious emergency flashlights now (12/15) put out 1,000 lumens and have remarkable runtimes. In their wake are small, highly affordable, waterproof, tough and reliable lights that can be carried in a pocket or pocketbook and powered by cheap disposable AA/AAA batteries. The Felix E12 boasts a bright, maximum 130 lumens and two lower settings that greatly extend battery life. But even at its brightest, you can get an hour and a half runtime. And when you turn the light on, it comes on in the lowest setting, then advances with each press of the button. Maximum runtime is 40 hours at the lowest setting of eight lumens (which is bright enough to see and navigate in most instances). And with the small flash head, you'll get plenty of flood, or spill.

A few of these lights in your emergency kits at home (with batteries), and you'll be ready for ice and snow storms, hurricanes and other disasters that may result in prolonged power outages. You'll still want it's big brothers for serious emergencies, and for those I recommend flashlights like the Klarus RS-20, Nitecore SRT7, Fenix PD35 and the Olight M20/21.

325,R1H1A8E2YH2MUM,True,"Excellent flashlight, don't bother to read this, just buy it","Disclaimer: I don't work for them, but I am total Fenix fanboy.

I love Fenix lights and this one didn't disappoint. It is just about perfect for what it is. The button is solid, the half-depress position to change light intensity is flawless. The construction quality is the same high standard as all Fenix lights I have owned. The light stages go from dim to astoundingly bright for a single AA.

My only complaint is that the holes for the included lanyard are teeny. They work great for the lanyard, but I don't like the lanyards and prefer a small loop and clip on my lights. Rigging one to this was highly challenging and involved a lot of work with 30 gauge wire, a magnifier, needle nose pliers and tweezers. Does anyone actually use lanyards on their flashlights? I have yet to meet anyone who does, but I guess they must be out there.

As with all the Fenix AA lights, the difference between this and the cheap $10 knock offs is stark. Worth every penny and when I inevitably lose this or give it to someone who's light has broken while we are working an incident, I will rebuy it right away.

EDIT: Sadly had to remove a star. After a couple of weeks of use in a desert environment, the switch went briefly intermittent on me. After a bit it went back to working properly but apparently the switch housing isn't fully sealed. Only removing one star because I used this on low every night for a few hours for two weeks and it is still on the same battery that came with it and other than this issue it was a complete champ for my trip. Probably 30+ hours on low and at least 1 on high and still has battery charge.

326,R39UO4WC3IJPP8,True,"After several years and several lights, the E12 is still a favorite","Being a collector of gadgets, I have a whole pile of flashlights. I was first introduced to Fenix lights years ago when I was looking at ""tactical"" lights. I bought one of their models that uses the CR123A batteries and that light was impressive even when compared to traditional quality brands like Surefire and Streamlight. When I began to look at lights using the more readily available and less costly AA and AAA batteries, it was a no brainer that I looked first at what Fenix offered. I bought an E12 and found it functional and reliable. As time passed and I accumulated other brands, the E12 remains one of my favorite and most used. One has ridden in my camera bag and in a carry-on bags during travel, one has been in my pocket frequently. They also serve as excellent gifts for friends and family.

There's nothing extraneous about the E12. It's simple to operate and puts out plenty of light. It uses standard AA alkalines or rechargables. It has three modes--Low, Medium and High. Low puts out enough light to see by indoors in the dark, medium puts out enough light for examination and search in low light and high is high enough for most outdoor activities at night. The beam is broad enough to cover a room and narrow enough to spot a subject outside. The light is small enough to drop in a large pocket or purse and forget it's there but it's large enough to handle and manipulate easily one-handed. There's no useless strobe or SOS function that many people only ever use by accident. This is simply a useful light for a good price.

It blows away any prior EDC flashlight I had in a similar price range. Its so small and light yet still very bright and sturdy. So far I have had no issues.

As for features the one thing it lacks is a belt clip. With my last EDC flashlight I was used to clipping the flashlight to the inside of my pocket, but with the E12 I just put it in my front pocket. I wasn't sure I liked this at first, but I've already gotten used to it.

The light switch brightness settings work by pressing on and off then on again. I don't love this design (I prefer a separate way to adjust brightness, or each press to increase brightness without turning off in between) but it's pretty typical. Starting on the LOW brightness is different than my prior EDC lights which started on the HIGH setting. Starting on LOW is nice because it encourages you to preserve battery and only increase brightness if you need it, rather than default to brightest setting.

You first have to push the tail switch all the way down the first time and then barely tap the switch to get the other strengths of illumination. At 130 lumens the brightness is very impressive.

It seems to be a very well made light, and I love having the capability to shine bright and far if needed (on high).
PROS: Well made, great size, and I like the interface.
CONS: I miss having a clip more than I thought I would. If your current light has a clip and you find yourself ever using it, you may want to pass on the E12. Rather than clipping securely to something, you're forced to let it ride in the pocket, which leads me to my next issue.
I do not know whether it came from the factory like this or not, but the lens appears to already be scuffed and scratched more than I would consider normal. To be sure, the bezel around the lens is barely raised to protect the lens, but I beat up my Pro-Tac 1AA for years and lens is still in new condition.

I love this because it doesn't look like something that belongs on a gun, just a cutesy little light that fits in my pocket no prob. Seems like good lights of that nature are hard to find. Compared to the L1T, it is more powerful, lighter, makes better use of the batter, and stands on its tail (which is super useful: fold a piece of paper over a light standing up and you have a great little lantern).

This is excellent in pretty much every way. I'm really sad that Fenix no longer makes said cutesy lights with glass lenses (like L1T); I'd much rather put down an extra 20 bucks for that.

346,RWK2WE0UELD0Q,True,"Great general purpose,multi-use AA battery flashlight","I just want to start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Fenix flashlights. Their flashlights are reliable and very sturdy - I accidently both dropped them on concrete and washed them in my washer and they still keep on working. I have their E21, LD01, and LD10 among a couple other flashlights. Each serves a different purpose and is good in their own way. But if you want an all around general purpose flashlight, you can't go wrong with the E12. It works on a single AA battery and the light is bright at 130 lumens. If you want something brighter, you would have to get a larger flashlight that takes more batteries and/or get a flashlight that takes CR123A batteries or 18650 Li-ion batteries, which can be pretty pricey. The other option is to go with the LD02 (1 AAA battery @ 100 lumens) or LD09 (1 AA battery at 130 lumens, but costs more). I am a big fan of the tactical tail switch of flashlights, which this one has. It's basically a pressable button at the end of the flashlight that let's you easily turn the flashlight on and off and/or switch between different modes/intensities of lighting. The E12 doesn't come with a case or a belt holster, which is a downer, but you can always buy it separately.

I tend to pick them up like fast food. I always seem to have one within reach at all times. So I've tried a few. And I'm not talking the cheap ones either. I've tried expensive ones but they have all, for the most part, been flawed. Usually, it has something to do with the battery contacts failing. Then, a few years ago, I inherited my Father's Fenix and I've been a convert ever since. When I needed a small, pocket flashlight that packed a punch, I immediately went to find a Fenix and the E12 fit the bill perfectly. It has the Fenix quality construction which means that even this tiny light feels rugged. And the tail switch is great. It's flush so you can actually stand the E12 up on it's end, which I understand was a critique of the previous E11 model. You have 3 modes to select from by simply tapping (or more accurately, very lightly pressing) the button to cycle through the different light levels. I spend a lot of my day working in a very dark room and the lowest mode is plenty. But it's nice to know that the brightest mode is enough to light up the opposite end of a hallway if need be!

It still has the best feel in the hand, and although it's not as bright as newer-generation models, it's still excellent for its intended purpose as a very compact light suitable for everyday carry or keeping in tight places.

+++

As of February, 2015, this is my favorite small flashlight. Obviously, LED technology is advancing quickly, so the efficiency and brightness of this unit will not be competitive in a couple of years, but right now, it's very bright, uses a common AA battery, has simple operation, is very solidly built. It feels great in the hand -- very satisfying to hold.

It's not much bigger than the battery that fuels it, which makes it excellent to keep in the car or stash in key locations around the house.

My only complaint is that it starts on the low setting, which seems counter intuitive: I usually use flashlights on their brightest settings, and sometimes dial the brightness back. So I have to tap the power button three times most of the time. Not sure why Fenix chose that sequence, and I hope they don't use that default in their designs in the future.

THE ONE CON is that it does not include or even have a corresponding pocket clip. It is SORELY needed on a flashlight of this size.

360,R3528L6H7PK2R2,True,Fenix E12 - Perfect EDC Light,"No matter how many flashlights I try, I always end up coming back to this one.

Pros:
Tail Stand - This one is big for me. I always rely on the tail stand capability and this one does it perfect.
Click Switch - Another important feature. It is super easy to use one handed. It is activated after the switch has been fully pushed and released, which I prefer. I have other lights that give momentary on, but I simply find them annoying.
Size - This fits perfect in my hand. It is a uniform size along the entire length, making it extremely comfortable to hold.
No Clip - I'm sure this might be a negative to some, but for me, I like to pocket carry my lights, and a clip just gets in the way. This thing disappears to the bottom of my pocket and stays out of the way.
Brightness - The 3 levels on this light are perfect for me. At 130 lumens max, it is plenty bright for most occasions

362,RZOCND62NKXN2,True,Love this light.,"This flashlight goes EVERYWHERE with me. As an RN, the low setting works great for pupil and neuro checks on patients without being painful on my patients' eyes. On medium it's more than bright enough for walking the dog and feeling secure on visibility. On high I can light up the room or see things well at the end of the yard.

And that's why I bought 2 of these babys. It's a perfectly thought out flashlight at a great price.

Here's an overview:
1. Common batteries, er, battery. AA is the most common battery out there.

2. Mode order. Low 1st. Medium 2nd. High 3rd. The quick half-click makes it quick to change modes.

3. Battery indicator. Sorta. As the battery drains, the higher settings don't come on. In other words, as you battery runs lower, the High mode will no longer turn on. Then, the Medium no longer turns on when your battery is almost drained. It gives you a heads up on the charge and keepa you from leaving you in the dark with prolonged use.

3. Build. Solid consteuction (mine has been dropped plenty of times with nothing besides a few amall scratches). Waterproof. Candle mode. Tail switch.

Construction/Design: The construction appears to be high-quality. The housing is solid and the action on the 3-mode button works very well. I haven't tried dropping it to test its durability, but it seems like it would handle drops OK. The light is easy to open to replace the battery but stays securely closed otherwise. The light tail-stands well when the included strap is not attached.

Run-time: The light runs for a really long time on a single battery, although I have not measured the actual run-time. I'd guess that the estimated run times from the manufacturer are accurate.

That exception is, that you cannot use the rear button to signal Morse code, nor any other thing you want to flash the light for. On the E11 predecessor, the high low beam was switched by turning the front dial, and the rear button was either momentary or permenant switch on and off. On the E12, the front dial does nothing at all, and the rear switch toggles between low, medium, and high beam. Some people might like this, but I will be keeping my E11 because I like theversatility of having two switches and being able to momentary flash the light.

Great size, excellent light output (puts my 3 D-cell led retrofitted Maglite to shame) and gets daily use. I have had to put new batteries in twice at this point- once, when the light would only give medium output and another time when the light went out completely.

The flashlight can now stand on end, permitting candle light usage. This was especially useful during a recent power outage. It illuminated the whole room on the dimmest mode!

391,R1NAH5DF0L6LMZ,True,EDC/Pocket flashlight thats strong and worth the money,"GREAT little flashlight.

The light defaults to the lowest setting of 8 lumens, and the user can cycle through low/med/high. This light does not have a momentary on setting; it's either on or off.

Machining is solid as to be expected, and the o-ring feels like it's going to keep out the moisture. There is only one point where the light screws apart (to install the battery). I also thought it a nice touch that the company added an extra o-ring in with the wrist lanyard and instructions.

I was worried reading reviews that lamented the long lost E11. Actually I like the E12 better if anything. The different switch doesn't bother me at all, and the fact that it always comes on in the dimmest of the 3 modes is perfect! I like tapping the button to change brightness much better than the funky ""screw the end down tighter to go bright"" method of the E11 (which I always just ran in full brightness). The ""dim"" mode is adequate for almost everything I do. So no complaints from me, I am delighted. I fully expect these to last for years in steady use, but only time will tell.

501,R3BD3Q28HVS9TN,True,I have had good luck with these Fenix lights (B00BNUBDKW),"UPDATE: After using the light a little longer, I noticed one odd attribute about the light. I""m lowering the stars from 5 to 3. When you first turn on the light, it turns on in lower power mode. You have to press the button on the end cap 2 more times to get to high power. That's pretty annoying when you are working on something and you don't need the light the whole time. So, you want to turn the light off for a minute to save the battery. When you turn it back on a few seconds or minutes later, it doesn't remember you had it on high power.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm not a flashlight nerd or anything. I just needed a light that would be there when I needed it. It's too early to say if that is the case. But, I'm getting tired of buying flashlights that spontaneously stop working. I have had good luck with these Fenix lights (B00BNUBDKW). So, I figured I'd take another chance on Fenix.

I can say that I'm very pleased with the light output. I think for general purpose, around the house, type usage, this light will be great. I also purchased the LD22 lights.

545,R1ST3E8S2XM5Y2,True,Not up to par with the E11 but OK.,"So, this is the replacement for the E11 - not really.

First, I gave my Daughter my old E11 because her husband kept stealing all the flashlights I gave her!!! I made her swear that she would not part with my E11 because it was the best light I had - she promised!!!

I got on Amazon to find that the E11 was not available unless you paid almost triple the value so, I looked at the ""replacement"" E12.

Simple makes me happy. On / off with the temporary light of the E11 was great. The E12 succumbed to the new ""in vogue"" of the triple level switch (8, 50 and 130 lumen) which negated the easy on / easy off and temporary light of the E11. Complex not so good.

Although I do like the fact that the levels go from low to high instead of reverse and that the tail switch only has to be barely tapped in order to roll through the levels of lumens you still have to cycle instead of the simplicity of the E11.

One other thing - there is no way that this light is 130 lumens on high. I'm betting when I see my daughter and make a side by side comparison with the 110 lumen E11 that the E11 will win the shootout!!!

That said, I will have to live with the E12's complexity and low lumen because I need a small light in my travels and this one with just 1 (one) AA battery is the best I could find.",the united states,"November 7, 2014",Mickey D,4.0,0,2020-11-12 11:50:34.929598,2020-11-12 11:50:35.055263,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

568,R3JII00TNH5MVQ,True,Layard holes too small and close to switch.,"I have had the Fenix LD01 flash light for four years and liked it. I missed placed it so I ordered this one. I carry the flash light on my belt clip everyday for work. The cheap key ring finally spread opened enough on the LD01 for the lanyard to fall out causing the flash light to fall off my belt unnoticed.

When I found the my old Fenix light (in my car) I bought several flat key ring to fit through the tiny openings at the bottom of the light but all were to big to fit through the Fenix holes. I decided to not cancel the order for this flash light hoping the holes would be bigger. They are the same small size and so close to the on/off button that only the included cloth lanyard could be threaded through the holes to then clip onto a D ring and my belt.

I am buying the item below. Hoping to savage off the black lanyard hoping it will fit through the small holes by the on/off button to then attach to a D ring or a Retractable Key Ring holder that I bought to solve the problem of connecting the light to by belt. This did not work. The O ring was too big to fit through the flashlight holes.

The lanyard that comes with this light is difficult to thread through the holes by the on/off button due the small space between the button and the holes. The included lanyard will not last long with everyday wear on my belt.

However, it's not my every ""night"" carry. Most of my flashlight use is at night. Especially when others are sleeping. At its dimmest setting, this light is way too bright for navigating around the bedroom when your spouse is sleeping, and too bright for comfort when you want to go to the bathroom at night without turning on the bright lights.

I've since purchased the Olight S1, with its 0.5 lumen mode, and love it. It's now my EDC and ENC, and the Fenix is in my backpack as a spare. The S1 also goes to 500 lumens, compared to the 130 of this light. I far more often need the ultra-low setting, but it's nice to have.

The first was a impulse buy at Home Depot for $12 two years ago and frankly, I like that one better. It is larger, has a more useful amount of light and remembers the last used setting. The Fenix light's default setting is only 8 Lumens and I think they should have made it at least 20. The next setting is 50 Lumens and bright is 130 Lumens. Basically, the brightness increases with the ratio of one level to the next, so they chose the jump from low to medium to be about 6:1 and the jump from med to high to be about 2:1.

745,RE109M4RPUBJF,True,"Quality, compact flashlight","I work in quality assurance and having a quality flashlight for inspections is a must. This one ticks all of boxes for me. Everyone else has big bulky flashlights that fall out of their pockets. This one is powerful enough to see into dark spaces, but small enough to go anywhere with me.

Pros:
Three light settings, with high being plenty powerful
AA battery powered for each power cell swap
Anodized aluminum body is durable
Lanyard is nice for not dropping it
Push button tail keeps accidental switch on to a minimum

Cons
Bigish hands might have a hard time holding it
Power button is a little stiff

778,R3G257TR2MGTXJ,True,Had to change my review,"I loved this flashlight for 2 days until problems developed. When I would screw it together all the way (completely tight) it would short circuit the battery. I found out about this because I thought the flashlight was off and put it in my pocket. A minute later it was blazing hot. I was able to determine that there wasn't a problem with the battery because it did the same thing with several other batteries. It worked fine as long as I didn't screw it together tightly. The o ring was in place and there was no obvious visual clue as to the cause of the short.

3 stars because it was probably just a QC issue. I didn't take my chances on an exchange.

782,R2NWO31V0BMJKW,True,Update: Failed after 1 year of very light service - was: AA mini flashlights micro review,"Pictured left to right in the attached photo are:
* Coast HP1 Focusing 190 Lumen LED Flashlight
* Gerber Recon Multicolor Flashlight, Black [22-80016]
* LRI PPRO Proton Pro White/Red, 2-Colors-in-1 LED Flashlight, 1-Pack
* Fenix Flashlights E12 130-Lumen Flashlight, Black
* Zebralight SC52Fw L2 AA Floody Flashlight Neutral White

Here are my micro thoughts on each:
* Coast HP1 Focusing 190 Lumen LED Flashlight
3 1/2 stars
Very bright. Larger and heavier than the others.
The only one here that is focusable for distance, thus is good for illuminating long distances.

* Gerber Recon Multicolor Flashlight, Black [22-80016]
3 stars
A nice little flashlight.
Uses simple rotating color filter wheel.
Not very bright.
Good if you require white, red, blue and green illumination.

* LRI PPRO Proton Pro White/Red, 2-Colors-in-1 LED Flashlight, 1-Pack
4 1/2 stars
This has been my goto flashlight for years.
As an amateur astronomer I require both red and white light.
This product has variable brightness for both red and white LEDs, from very dim to very bright.
I ding it a half star because the firmware can be a little flaky sometimes, I think when the battery is getting low.
Overall an excellent product though.

* Fenix Flashlights E12 130-Lumen Flashlight, Black
4 1/2 stars
This is an excellent little flashlight.
Very light and small.
Very bright.
I have only owned it a short time though.
I ding it a half star because it only supports 3 brightness levels, not full variable brightness.
It is very easy to toggle between the 3 brightness levels though.
Also note that the ergonomics could be improved as it difficult to discern front from back by feel-
I find I am pushing in the lens to try to get it to turn on!

* Zebralight SC52Fw L2 AA Floody Flashlight Neutral White
4 stars
This is also a nice little flashlight.
It is quite dim in its lowest setting so this is what I use nightly around the house.
The Fenix Flashlights E12 even in its lowest setting is too bright for me around the house at night.
I love the ergonomic ribbing on the Zebralight.
It may not be bright enough in its bright setting to go camping with for example.
This flashlight has the best ergonomics of all reviewed, with a nice large easy-to-find button to turn it on.
It fits in the hand great.

Update: 11/1/2017
This flashlight was purchased 11/2016. It died 11/1/2017.
I believe the switch broke, as is reportedly common with these flashlights.
I attempted to remove the rear of the flashlight to tighten the switch assembly, a reported fix, but could not do so.
After a half-hour of trying with various vice grips it went in the recycle bin.
I am reverting to the Proton Pro, which, while its firmware is somewhat flaky, has never failed in the field under tough use.",the united states,"December 29, 2016",MarkB,2.0,0,2020-11-12 11:52:52.322004,2020-11-12 11:52:52.453687,Fenix E12 Flashlight 130 Lumens,4.6,75.01,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00I14HLLS,,"#59,578 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

802,RFP4RPJQIDQ7S,True,"Best small flashlight I have ever purchased, hands down.","I recently purchased this flashlight (Fenix E-12) and I could not be happier. I have been using it frequently, and carrying it daily. It is small enough to fit easily in my pocket and makes a superb addition to what I carry every day. It feels durable, has faultless high quality construction, and is exactly the width of my palm. From an ease of operation standpoint, the button is nicely recessed, and has a full push to click on function. Once on, a further small push will enter the medium bright, and a second push into full bright modes. In full brightness mode, it is quite bright, and in a dark room, is bright enough to light up the whole room. I feel the beam is a good trade off between focus and spread for anything up to about 30 yards. It comes with a small lanyard, which I have attached but rarely use. One of my favorite features is the AA battery (it takes 1), and I haven't had to replace it yet. I looked through a lot of different options online to fit my specific requirements, and this flashlight was what I decided upon, and I am glad I did.
As a United States Marine I know the tactical utility of a quality flashlight, and this one fits the bill. As a medical student, this is a perfect addition to my patient exam gear, but is too bright to be comfortable for eye examinations.

816,R2UMFXUZD0VOXN,True,"Long battery life, AA powered, but not quite as bright as I expected it to be","After reading several reviews of the E12 I decided to give it a try. I will start by saying that as always with Amazon I received the light in a timely manner and it was packaged well.

The light is very small, just a inch or so bigger than a AA battery. It seems to be well built and feels solid. I installed the battery that was included with it and immediately hit the switch to try it out. On the low setting, the light is very dim. Of course the battery life on low is something ridiculous so that's a bit of a trade off. On medium and high it is bright. Comparing it's high rating of 130 lumens to other lights I have in the 100-150 class it doesn't seem to be as bright as I would expect. Still it's bright enough for most tasks but it would not be my first pick to investigate when something goes bump in the night.

For its intended purpose of a small but adequately powered light for carrying all the time it should work well. I chose this light in part due to the fact that it uses AA batteries which can be found anywhere. I was in a new city once and trying to find replacements for cr123 batteries was impossible. The lights starts on low and you must tap the tail switch to cycle to medium and high. I would prefer it to start on high, but that's just my personal preference. I hope to update this after using the light for a few weeks.

It has 3 settings which is also stupid, since who on the planet actually uses the middle setting? Worse, it starts on the lowest setting, which is uselessly dim (for a $30 light). It doesn't remember what your last setting was. I know they say it's because that way it has the longest battery life, and doesn't overly blow out your eyes when you first turn it on, but to me, that's lame. When people want light, they want light. And making people click through the settings using the same buttons, means:

876,R125RY5HQNCBPM,True,高水準でまとまった性能を持つ、コンパクトライト。,"いきなりですが、悪い点から。

中心の光の強さの割に周辺への散光はかなりぼんやりしてます。ライトを進行方向に向けて歩きながら、視界の端や目線のみで足元を確認するのがやりづらいです。
屋外ではハイモードをメインに使うことになりますが、周辺光で見辛いからといって中心光で足元を照らすと、今度は眩しすぎます。

悪い点2つ目は点灯時間。
エネループプロだと入らないライトも所有しているので、エネループの標準タイプ、1900mAhのものを使っているのですが、ハイモードだと1時間と保たずにガクンと暗くなってしまいます。
130ルーメンは1AA(単３電池1本)とはいえ今どき突出した光量でもないので、点灯時間はもっと頑張って欲しいところ。

それ以外は良いライトです。
アンチロールこそ考慮されてませんが、凹凸の少ない円筒型のボディはポケットからの出し入れがしやすい。他社の1AAライトを含めても最小クラスの全長と合わさって、持ち歩きやすさは群を抜きます。
滑り止めのチェッカリングは服の繊維を引っ掻けない程度ながらも濡れた手でもしっかり保持できる絶妙さ。
深さ2mの水没にも耐える防水力は、アウトドア用としてはもちろん、水害の多い日本における防災用懐中電灯として頼もしい。
比較的小さめの中心光のおかげで、いわゆる""飛び""が良く、30mぐらい先でも人や看板など垂直な対象であればしっかり照らしだせる。
特に気に入ったのが、逆手でも順手でも明るさ切り替えと電源オンオフが出来る操作性。コレで間欠点灯と前回使った明るさを記憶する機能があれば最高だったのですが、贅沢な要望かなと。

実はかなり気に入ってるのですが、懐中電灯として重要な配光と点灯時間にやや難アリなので、星4つとさせていただきます。
その辺り改善されたバージョンが出たなら、2000円ぐらい高くても買っちゃうかも。

2016/9/28追記
自分は9/11に3000円程度で買ったんですが、なんだか5000円ぐらいに値上がりしてますね…
