2,R1ZAFANWDDACYW,True,Good flashlight,"I needed a good quality light for work and did some research which said to get at least 1,000 lumens. So that’s what I did, and it’s overkill. Luckily it’s dimable. On the medium setting I can light up an object almost 100 yards away, and I mean light it completely up, not just cast a dim light on it. Probably perfect for police or rescue work.
The only thing I don’t like is the beam doesn’t adjust, but I’m use to it. The rechargeable battery seems to last a long time as long as I keep it off the highest output setting.

3,RP9MI732RSJAK,True,Could be better.,"It's bright but my love with the flashlight ended shortly after the return window.

The switch from Turbo to User Defined does not feel natural and takes 2 hands to do so -- which isn't always ideal.
After about 30 days the flashlight started to flicker from time to time and even turn off even though it was fully charged. Apparently, it's something that is pretty common with newer NiteCores. Would love to return or exchange it but I think I have to now go through the warranty. I have since upgraded to an OLight Warrior X Pro which seems to be better quality meets my needs better.

Also, mine did not come with the Edison Bright Batteries.",the united states,"October 22, 2020",TonyG,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:36:05.314219,2020-11-12 14:36:05.562736,"NiteCore MH25 CREE XM-L U2 LED 960 Lumens USB Rechargeable Flashlight, 18650 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery, USB Charging Cable and Holster, Black",4.2,112.24,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00GZA1V02,,"#272,481 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I am visually impaired and was looking for a super bright flashlight which was durable and long lasting. I chose a tactical flashlight for this reason. The product works excellent and well worth the money that I spent. The CR123 batteries that were in the box work fine and so did the rechargeable battery pack that was included. The battery pack worked on high power for only a short time. I did what anyone else would do - I plugged up the USB cable and attempted to charge the light. I used the included USB cable in addition to several that I keep around my office and the light barely gets a charge at all!
