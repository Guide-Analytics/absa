0,R1KID9FHOJJJA8,True,Amazing Little Flashlight,"Let me start off by saying that I have a problem when it comes to flashlights. I have a collection of over 30 different flashlights from all the big brands. This little flashlight is my go-to 9 out of 10 times. The 920 lumen output is not an exaggeration. When on turbo mode (max brightness), it easily outshines other brand flashlights claiming to be 1000+ lumens.
The buttons are a designed perfectly. While some flashlights have a single power/brightness button requiring you to turn the flashlight off and on several times to get to the desired brightness, this flashlight has the power button on the end and the brightness controls on the body. As the product page indicates, there are 5x brightness levels of the main LED and one level for the red LED. In order to change between the brightness levels you simply press the button closer to the front to increase and closer to the back to decrease. If you decrease the brightness past the lowest level the red LED turns on. If you hold down either of the buttons by themselves instead of pressing and releasing, it will change directly to the brightest mode or the red LED without having to go through the steps. I typically use this when wanting to switch to the red LED without having to press a button multiple times.
Which brings me to the red LED. This is one of the few flashlights I could find that includes a red LED. This mode is perfect if you are outside in the dark and need to see where you're going but don't want to create too much light. It's not nearly as noticeable or distracting as a while LED.
Finally, I find the size to be perfect when doing other tasks with your hands that require a flashlight. It is so compact and lightweight that it makes it remarkably easy to carry. It I am carrying it in a pocket, I often forget it's there. At the same time, it does not feel too small that I'm worried I might drop it, nor does it feel delicate or fragile.
The only potential negative for some would be that it uses a smaller battery than most flashlights. If you have an existing charger, make sure it can charge 18350 batteries. Otherwise, purchase a charger that can.",the united states,"December 8, 2018",Nathan,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:34:16.462823,2020-11-12 14:34:16.783180,"Nitecore MT10C 920 Lumen Multitask Tactical Flashlight with Red Light, Rechargeable Battery, and LumenTac Battery Organizer",4.7,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B013KE11ZA,"{'product dimensions': '9.12 x 2.54 x 2.54 cm; 56.98 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.', 'item model number': 'MT10C', 'is discontinued by manufacturer': 'No', 'color': 'Red', 'bulb type': 'LED', 'material': 'Anodized Aluminum', 'power source': 'Battery', 'included components': 'Flashlight, Keychain Light', 'batteries included?': 'No', 'battery description': '18350, CR123', 'brand': 'Nitecore', 'item weight': '56.9 g'}",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61u-uRENILL._AC_SX425_.jpg
1,R3C2NBN01UAJAO,True,stupid bright - palm-sized powerhouse,"Great EDC light. on max setting, it is devastatingly bright. the The clip is reversible, so it could be easily clipped on the bill of a hat. The only problem, the clip in the middle, so it leaves the light half in, half out of a pocket, but the clip grip is very firm. this little thing is so awesome for its price, still worthy of 5 stars.

bottom line - this light will exceed your expectations. if it had a tailcap for a remote switch and a picatinny rail mount, it would be a superb weapon light, and then would excel at literally everything one would require this light to do.

UPDATE 5-26-19: I have now lost this light 5 times. This 5th time, it has not been found. The clip on this light is horrible. It leaves half of this light out of your pocket, regardless of how it is clipped, or how tight the clip is, you will find it missing from your pocket. It catches EVERYTHING. This light needs a redesign to fix this, then it will be the perfect EDC all-purpose light. Until then, 3 stars.",the united states,"February 20, 2019",L Holder,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:34:16.791159,2020-11-12 14:34:17.044200,"Nitecore MT10C 920 Lumen Multitask Tactical Flashlight with Red Light, Rechargeable Battery, and LumenTac Battery Organizer",4.7,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B013KE11ZA,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61u-uRENILL._AC_SX425_.jpg
2,R19E4UIW78UKB6,True,Perfect EDC light,"I've had my MT10C light for over 9 months. It's been in my right front pocket next to my wallet the entire time. I generally use the 70 lumen setting as it's enough light for most purposes. Being able to easily crank up the output if required is one of the great features.
I do use the red led option at night around the house. We got a puppy this Spring and while she was being housebroken there were accidents. Red gave me the ability to see where I was stepping without disturbing others.
The ability to use the light itself to tell me how much power it left in the battery is comforting as well.

The only drawback I've found is that there isn't any good battery cases that will handle a single 18350 battery as I like to have a spare on me. Currently I'm dealing with the extra bulk of a County Comm 18650 battery case to hold an 18350 plus a CR123 battery as well as that plastic sleeve which is supposed to reduce the rattling when you're using a CR123.

I picked up a charger as well so I've got 3 cells in rotation, 1 in the light, 1 in the holder in my pocket and 1 on my nightstand. I'd have been fine with 2 cells but the other charger came with 2 so I wasn't complaining (great deal).

While camping last month I did use the light to settle down some kids (junior high to high school age) who were running down the road at the campground at night. 70 lumens was enough to stop them in their tracks as they didn't realize that we (my girlfriend, puppy and myself) were walking on the road ahead of them in the dark. I know that a higher output would have been better but I wanted light RIGHT NOW. It was easy to pull it out of my pocket and hit the switch.

Yes, for what's currently out there I consider this to be my perfect EDC light.",the united states,"August 31, 2019",Steelheart,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:34:17.052194,2020-11-12 14:34:17.299651,"Nitecore MT10C 920 Lumen Multitask Tactical Flashlight with Red Light, Rechargeable Battery, and LumenTac Battery Organizer",4.7,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B013KE11ZA,,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61u-uRENILL._AC_SX425_.jpg
3,R23VSSI5FVU9P5,True,Lightweight Eyeball blaster!,"I love the compactness of this flashlight! It's super small, and you can ""hide"" it in your fist if you need to. Sometimes to perform security duties for me place of worship and this helps out tons! I use the low settings the most to light up the ground so that the friends can safely make it to the door at night.

In a pinch I would say the strobe would incapacitate someone to give you extra time to get away from an assailant. Never had to yet, but good to know that you could. The red LED is fantastic at night if you need to read something in the car, or look for your cellphone that fell in between the seat and center console...

4,R2Z23OCQNXI78W,True,EDC that lasts,"I have a couple Nitecore lights for EDC. I also have lights from Klarus, Olight, Thrunite, and others. This is by far my favorite EDC light, one that I carry every day. I love the up and down brightness buttons, the ""candlelight"" setting, the red map light setting, and the very, very nice end cap press switch. If I didn't already have all my ARs and shotguns equipped with other lights I'd consider using this one for tactical purposes, too.

Yeah. Small, light, bright, tough. Can't go wrong.

P.S. -- forgot to mention that this is the 2nd one of these I got. The first one went to a wheelchair buddy who saw me using it and asked for one of his own.

5,R1OU19W33T69Z4,True,Perfect every day carry flashlight.,"What an awesome little flashlight. I needed a flashlight to carry with me wherever I go and I wanted something small. Some of my co-workers really like flashlights and specifically recommended this one to me so I bit the bullet. When it came I was pleasantly surprised that it was exactly the size I was looking for. Im also happy that the clip it comes with appears very sturdy so I can clip it to my pants pocket and don't have to worry that it's going to fall. I like all the modes too, the red light is perfect for checking a quick document at night when you don't want to lose your night vision or don't want broadcast your location.

I have too many flashlights- mostly Nitecore, Olight, and Thrunight. This little light is a great light. I love the tail switch for quickness of use in the dark.
