The levels of brightness are perfect for different tasks and different levels or darkness. I have a competitor product that is more expensive and I prefer the light from this flashlight. The one thing I do not like is the location of the side switch and the usb port. You can easily confuse the two in the dark but after regular use you can feel the subtle difference between the two. The one thing this is missing is a tail switch, which I don't mind because the competitor product I have has one. This one can stand on its tail though which is great when you need a light source and both hands available.",canada,"April 7, 2017",Jay Cee,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:10:29.429720,2020-11-12 15:10:29.676805,"NiteCore MH10 USB Rechargeable Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 Portable Torch Waterproof Compact Searchlight with NL183 2300mAh 18650 Battery, Black",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00SRDTBF2,"{'product dimensions': '13 x 2.54 x 2.54 cm; 81.65 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium Metal batteries required.

1,R2C8QNE17NZX4T,True,Awesome light!,"I am blown away by this light.

It is extremely well made, and built like a tank! I feel as though it would not break if dropped.

Feels comfortable and lightweight in the hand, and doesn't get hot (just warm), even with extended use on high.

The operation of this light is very simple, and the instructions are very clear.

The different modes are very useful, going from dimmest (good for reading) to brightest (if you ever need to blind an attacker, search for a missing person in the woods....or signal the international space station), plus strobe and SOS.

The charging is fast.

All in all, I love this light, and am happy to EDC it.",canada,"July 20, 2016",Shayne Melvin,5.0,0,2020-11-12 15:10:29.687024,2020-11-12 15:10:29.912390,"NiteCore MH10 USB Rechargeable Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 Portable Torch Waterproof Compact Searchlight with NL183 2300mAh 18650 Battery, Black",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00SRDTBF2,,"#181,000 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

4,R2T5ZMCHILZVZ8,False,the power button is very easy to get triggered when placed in the flashlight holder,"I have to give this one a review. first of all it saved my life. i went on a 2 days hiking trip on the way down it was sunset all my friend's flashlight died except mine. 8 people followed behind me and reach to the parking lot safely. this light is the brightest compare to all my friend's flashlight.
HOWEVER, the flashlight did not come with few items as it PROMISED. it's missing BATTERY CASE, WALL CHARGER, and CAR CHARGER.
IT came with O ring, wrist strap, the flashlight metal holder, the flashlight case, and usb cable
Pros: Bright, water proof,and the most important one USB charging port!!!!
Cons: 1.USB cable material is a bit on the cheap side. it's not the highest quality usb cable.
2.the Max lighting turns it self off automatically after 5 mins of use because it says it will over heat. (from my usage it was in the very cold weather flash light only operate at warm temperature. it should have a heat sensor so it does not turn it self to medium setting after 5 mins of usage.
3. the power button is very easy to get triggered when placed in the flashlight holder. (on the way down of the hike, i needed the flashlight i turn it on it was on the low battery because it was turned on by accident inside the case thank god it's USB rechargeable)

Update June.08.17
So the USB port part is broken. I tried to reach out to Amazon Customer service they ask me to contact nitecore personally since the website does not state any warranty information. According to nitecore website they have a 5 year limited warranty but when i eamil them about this issue. No one replied. recently i just bought TM26 as well now i am worried if something goes wrong and it will turn out to be a pretty expensive investment. I expect these flashlight to last very long time, and it's less than year it's broken? and no one replied on the email",canada,"September 19, 2016",huang,1.0,1,2020-11-12 15:10:30.290590,2020-11-12 15:10:30.449571,"NiteCore MH10 USB Rechargeable Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 Portable Torch Waterproof Compact Searchlight with NL183 2300mAh 18650 Battery, Black",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00SRDTBF2,,"#181,000 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

14,RLVKF1W16J59A,True,"Tiny and powerful, exactly the light I was looking for","I use for automotive work and it's the perfect companion. Small enough to keep in my pocket and incredibly bright. I bought this to replace some much larger LED flashlights I bought at Costco that use 3 C cell batteries. This is easily 3x brighter in a much smaller package.

Pros:
Tiny
Powerful - I played around with this indoors. I'd guess it's about as bright as a 40w light bulb except focused. You can put this on a table easily read from the reflected light bounced off the ceiling.
Rechargeable - save money on batteries
Consistent light output - unlike alkaline battery powered lights, light output does not fall off as batteries discharge
Durable - water resistant
Easy to use switch - tap to turn on, tap to turn off, none of this triple clicking like cheaper flashlights/torches. Plus, it remembers the last selected brightness level.
Appears to be modular in design - maybe possible to extend the barrel to double battery capacity?
Wrist strap is also useful for hanging
Rechargeable - my old flashlight used 3 C cell batteries and was expensive to replace. Just charge after using and you always have a full battery.

Cons:
Some fumbling to find the power button. I'd prefer a button on the end of the stalk. This one is near the front
USB charge flap doesn't always stay closed

The MH10 does not have a tailcap switch, and the modes are accessed in a slightly different way from those that do. The single switch operation is handy. A quick double click activates strobe.

16,R3RVC8RTKJYHJN,True,"Slight struggle in finding power button, but otherwise a very high quality flashlight.","Excellently powerful. I was surprised by the small size and how ridiculously bright it is. The weight it has gives it a premium quality feel. Easy to mount on anything as it has lots of flat and round bits. Knurled metal is pleasant to grip. Excellent product.

The only issue I had was that I realized a tail button would be really helpful, especially since the multi-function power button is recessed and kind of annoying to find. I would highly recommend to the manufacturer that they consider extending the button but just a few mm's outwards as it would help squash this tiny annoyance!

Please do realize that I am nitpicking as the flashlight works exactly as described and I had no real issues with it in the short time that I had it. The charging port worked, though I can't comment on its durability (didn't keep it around long enough).

Stop considering buying this flashlight and buy it. It's incredible. I might own 20 flashlights. It's a problem, I know. This one takes the cake, so far. Re-chargeable, easy to use, and a good range of modes.

I hate these flashlights that have a dozen modes. Why? Seriously, why? What person in their right mind needs the option to run 1 lumen to 1000 lumens in intervals of 8? And seven different strobe modes, and SOS in three different languages? It's ridiculous.

This light is a piece of cake to find the on/off button in the dark. It's directly opposite from the charging port. They feel the same to the touch, so I just press both of them and on it comes. Quick and easy to switch modes. The low mode is perfect for not blinding myself and the highest mode (it's something like 1,000 lumens) is great for blinding others. Or just showing off.

29,R13RVDNGR4H02R,True,A great flashlight that suffers from a poorly designed power button,"There was a lighting tech at work who had one of these and let me fiddle with it a bit. I was taken in by the multiple intensity levels, its durability, and the battery life. The power button was a little hard to find (flush on the side of the barrel and not that pronounced), but I was sure it would be easier to manage with constant use.

So I bought it...and instantly hated it that same week.

After a couple of months of having it, finding that power button is still a struggle and extremely inconvenient for my line of work. (The mini-usb port is on the opposite side of the button that half the time you end up pressing that instead.)

Also, the power switch is so touchy that it would always turn itself on in the holster or my pocket and I would be none the wiser until I tried to use it later and realize that the battery was dead.

I'm just really bummed that the flashlight itself is amazing, but if I can't rely on it to use it on-the-fly, than Nitecore should reconsider its design.",the united states,"November 13, 2017",Liz,2.0,0,2020-11-12 15:10:39.991610,2020-11-12 15:10:40.141391,"NiteCore MH10 USB Rechargeable Flashlight CREE XM-L2 U2 Portable Torch Waterproof Compact Searchlight with NL183 2300mAh 18650 Battery, Black",4.5,,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00SRDTBF2,,"#181,000 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

63,R226MX7F42G8NF,True,great flashlight for a short period,purchased this light in april of 2017. it was a great light the first 3 months. i even told 3 of my coworkers about it who also purchased the flashlight. the last 2 months my flashlight has been nothing but issues now. It now only works on the brightest setting so it kills the flash light very quick and it wont switch to the lower settings at all. I can only turn it off by taking the battery off. about 10% of the time it will turn off by pushing the button. Any time i plug it in to the charger it turns on and i cant get a proper charge on it. Overall it was a great flashlight when it worked as intended.
