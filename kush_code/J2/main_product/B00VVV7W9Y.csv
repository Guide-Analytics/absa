0,R3X2HVL7EMWDI,True,"Ghost battery drain, no tail switch.","I bought this to replace my Nitecore MT10C which I had lost on shift (later found by a coworker weeks later) - which is an amazing compact flash light. I assumed when I bought this light that it had a tail switch but it does not - the very small buttons on the side are not effective to activate the light quickly or under stress, especially when holding the light naturally in your hand with your thumb at the rear. The two brand new batteries (18350) that were provided were both found dead a few days after putting it in when I went to use the light - this light had a major ""Ghost Draw"" problem so when you go to use your light after a week or so it has killed the battery and is useless. I tried a CR123 and it flickered and barely performed. I can only use this light if I store the battery separately and have to take it out after each use or it will just drain on its own.

3,R1KG7T0U9QIO6P,True,Perfect EDC Flashlight,"Pros: Good size for EDC, comes with 2 batteries, extremely bright, different modes
Cons: Modes can be confusing, slight hum when on

This torch is great for everyday carry - it's the perfect size and has a decent battery life considering how many lumens it puts out. For about $50, it's pretty cheap for an EDC torch and it comes with two batteries. Other things that come in the box include a lanyard, holster, a sheath for smaller batteries (16340 and CR123), extra o-rings, and a metal clip. The body has an octagonal ring around it to prevent rolling, which is a nice touch. The flashlight measures just shy of 3"" long and has a diameter of 1"". It weighs 1.6oz without a battery and 2.2oz with the included battery.

The EC11 is perfect for everyday carry. It's small enough to be able to fit into your pocket or pack, but it packs a punch. The maximum output is 900 lumens, which is extremely bright and more than enough for most situations. However, it cannot run continuously at 900 lumens for an extended period of time. The flashlight will actually dim itself after a few minutes to protect it from overheating. There is also a secondary red LED, which is a nice feature for when very low light is needed and/or for situations where you don't want to give your position away. There's also a strobe, SOS, and beacon mode. Each mode can be accessed through manipulation of the two buttons. I'm not a huge fan of the mode button since it takes a little bit to get used to (I prefer the tactical ring more), however, the smallest flashlight with the SRT is still a bit too large for EDC.

I noticed that there is a very faint hum when it is on; it's only audible if you put it next to your ear. It's not a huge deal, but it is there.

In the picture, I put the EC11 next to an SRT3 so you can get an idea how big it is.",the united states,"May 13, 2017",PLin,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:20:56.607801,2020-11-12 14:20:56.875011,"NiteCore CREE XML2 900 lm LED Flashlight Secondary Red with 18350 Battery, Black, Left/Right",3.8,92.70,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00VVV7W9Y,,"#301,470 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

4,RJLJNOXAO7RKQ,True,Nice Light but poor choice for the controls,"Like many I have way too many FL as it is. My favorite EDC FL is a ProTac 1L, but they are no longer made. Single CR123a battery with good life, small foot print, amazingly bright and most importantly a large rear facing activation. Road testing the XML2 the first frustration was with pocket clip and activation controls. This thing does not come out of the pocket and get turned on instinctively with its tiny dual button controls that are side mounted somewhere ???? It is not easy to find the buttons by braille. MY only fix is to run the pocket clip adjacent to the controls so I have kenestic clues as to where the blink the buttons are, Way too small and too close together to activate full thumb and one needs thumb nail and technique to brandish this light in any real world amount of time.

5,R2IRKQUGKO9UW0,True,Impressive,"Totally Bad A## Flashlight. Small yet incredibly bright. And it has a red LED too. All sorts of cool things like you can power it down completely. When powered up, even if white light is off, the red LED will blink every minute(ish), which is really cool if you drop it a night. The batteries tht come with are rechargable, and it also can use CR123A batteries. They are a little thinner that what it comes with but included is a little sheath for the thinner battery so it fits snugly. I have a number of Nitecore lights and they are all great. Have had issues with a prior one wherein I dropped it from say 3 feet and it stopped working. They have 7 year warranty and fixed it (but I had to ship it to China).

7,R29320J41SXMAA,True,Excellent flashlight/minor gripes,"Overall very nice flashlight. Well made and we'll finished. Very bright and quite a bit of options packed into a small package.
A couple of small personal preference gripes:
1. It's great that there are so many light options but how much is too much? It's almost to the point that it makes the flashlight operation a tad unintuitive in my opinion. It's like relearning old school Nintendo controller combos to access special levels. Ok that may be a bit extreme but you get my drift.
2. Replacing the battery is easy. But you have two options: remove the clip, or drag it over the buttons or slightly lift it over. If the cap was shortened a tad to raise the thread placement above the clip it would be perfect.
Overall these are eye of the beholder type gripes and should in no way take away from the overall quality of the flashlight, but sometimes simplicity should trump number of features and size.",the united states,"February 14, 2019",sininfarina,4.0,0,2020-11-12 14:20:57.549520,2020-11-12 14:20:57.723492,"NiteCore CREE XML2 900 lm LED Flashlight Secondary Red with 18350 Battery, Black, Left/Right",3.8,92.70,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00VVV7W9Y,,"#301,470 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

8,R3HB4ULU2ET111,True,Nice little light with a bit of a learning curve.,"I've been quite happy with this light, though my review may focus on negative aspects.

I would not purchase this flashlight for tactical use with a handgun due to the switch being on the side of the barrel making it unsuitable to handle with a reverse grip, and there's no tactical ring for switching modes.

The mode switch and power switch are tiny and placed against one another, making it easy to hit the wrong button, and when clipped inside a pocket it's easy to brush against the buttons and turn it on when unintended.

Whenever I hand this off to someone who asks to borrow a light, it can be amusing to watch them try to work it. As a bonus I don't think anyone would try to steal it.

This light works for me. It might work for you, but frankly it would be better if it was just a few mm longer to accommodate a rear cap on-off button and integrated charging.",the united states,"August 27, 2020",Steven Dickerson,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:20:57.731247,2020-11-12 14:20:57.899849,"NiteCore CREE XML2 900 lm LED Flashlight Secondary Red with 18350 Battery, Black, Left/Right",3.8,92.70,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00VVV7W9Y,,"#301,470 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

12,R3KYNPBUQDBWSI,True,Small and Bright,"Amazing flashlight as long as you know it's downfalls before purchase.

Where it shines (no pun intended):
Bright as hell for its size
Small
Deep reflector for a nice throw
Great ui ( user interface)

Where this light falls short:
Run time is abysmal, even at low settings
( can't expect long times with so many lumens from this form factor. This con is understandable)

There is a phantom power draw, battery will only last 3 mo. Even if you do not turn it on.
(Probably because the UI has memory, but still 3 mo. Is not a long time. Also IMR batteries have no protection, so if you leave them in and don't use the light, it will kill your batteries if you let the voltage drop too low.

This light works great, has been my backup for years now.

The batteries that came with it both stopped working at the same time. One of them gets much more usage than the other so both of them junking out at the same time was odd.

I have many Nightcore lights, I have the tm26, tm36, srt7, P20UV, MH20GT and of course the EC 11 which is my personal favorite, it checks off all of my needs for the best EDC flashlight. This thing has many features it has a steady red light, red light beacon, red light flasher, white ultra low, low, medium, high, and turbo, SOS, strobe, beacon, and a battery voltage checker and access to instant strobe, instant ultra low and instant turbo, it even has a lock out mode and I really nifty reversible pocket clip that doubles as a hat clip. The two 700 mah MIR batteries hold a decent charge. You charge your cell phone every night but you won't have to charge this one but once a week even if you use it everyday for a few minutes.

45,RL0EGLYN8N0GJ,True,Seemed like a great light. But...poorly designed belt case failed—causing me to lose it before I'd had much time to use it.,"Ok... so, the light arrived quickly and was excellent. Mostly. The beam pattern was perfect. Nice throw, but with plenty of smooth spill. The light was a little larger than the Olights I've been using, but not that much, and it really was noticeably brighter on high. The interface was complicated, but I was starting to get the hang of it when...there was a significant problem with one of the accessories that caused a total failure of the light (sort of). The light included a belt case that seemed to be a good case. I have lost a couple small lights, because they have fallen out of pockets or the clips has come off my pockets. The case gave me hope that I would be able to keep this one secure on my belt when it wasn't in use. Instead, it turned out to be the reason I lost the light. I took the light with when I went fishing on a trout stream near my home. It was the first time I had tried using the case—I usually kept the light clipped to my hat brim for walking the dog. But this time, just a week or two after I got the light, since it was not yet dark, I thought the case would be more secure, and attached it, securely to my belt. The belt loop on the case was sewn on the top, but attached with velcro at the bottom. That seemed like a good idea, but it apparently didn't hold, because when I went to get the light to put on my hat after it started to get dark and I was ready to start walking back to my car, the light and the case were gone. I fortunately had a back-up light, and went back to look for it. I retraced my steps everywhere but through the stream where I had been wading. If the case had a fully-sewn belt loop, I wouldn't have lost it.

67,R2JF2AQ9Q45RL8,True,I still rate the flashlight four stars for a great performance from the light itself,"This flashlight was frustrating in two ways rights out of the box. It almost had me rating this light at 3 stars. First, the lanyard attachment point is so small, the lanyard is almost impossible to attach. I ended up having to find some thread to pull the lanyard through the landyard attachment point. Second, after the clip was attached it immediately began gouging the anodized finish of the flashlight.

I still rate the flashlight four stars for a great performance from the light itself. A nice set of steps in light output and the feature where the red led can report current battery voltage is nice. Note that the batteries will not hold up long in this light give the batteries the very small form factor allows for.

73,RZYX8ONVEKTNW,True,Great Flashlight with One Dangerous Fatal Flaw,"Great light, bright and very portable but... I got this light to carry in my pants pocket, I always like to have a flashlight with me. Used it for a couple of days when one day I noticed my pants were getting HOT, and not in a good way. The light had turned itself on in my pocket and was set at the 900 lumin setting. Pulled it out ant the flashlight had gotten hotter than I could comfortably hold it. To get the maximum output you need to use the Nitecore high output batteries, I don't know what would have happened if I didn't turn it off when I did. OK, I still liked this light so when I put it in my pocket I would just use the lockout function. Have to hold both buttons simultaneously for 3 seconds to turn it on. Don't know why but twice after that when I went to use the light the battery was dead, I figure somehow the red light turned on in my pocket without me realizing it. I don't carry extra batteries with me and I worry the light may turn on and catch fire. I haven't figured out what I'll do with it but I'm afraid to carry it in my pocket. Replaced this light with the Nitecore MT10C",the united states,"January 3, 2017",Wild Bill,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:21:40.196348,2020-11-12 14:21:40.343699,"NiteCore CREE XML2 900 lm LED Flashlight Secondary Red with 18350 Battery, Black, Left/Right",3.8,92.70,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00VVV7W9Y,,"#301,470 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

74,R3Y3EZCWQ32X8,True,NOT RELIABLE!!!!,"Owned this for a couple of months. At first, I thought it just guzzled batteries, but in fact, it simply does not work after a month or so. Put a fresh battery in and still cannot get it to activate in any mode. And I tried everything to reset it. Just doesn't work. Given the simplicity of flashlight designs, I can't imagine how someone could botch it so badly! Additionally, before it stopped working completely, it would turn on inside my pocket no matter how I positioned it due to the buttons being on the side. It would get scorching hot. My advice: Stick with Fenix or SOG models.",the united states,"April 11, 2017",Indrid Cold,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:21:40.348223,2020-11-12 14:21:40.497099,"NiteCore CREE XML2 900 lm LED Flashlight Secondary Red with 18350 Battery, Black, Left/Right",3.8,92.70,,Tools & Home Improvement,B00VVV7W9Y,,"#301,470 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
