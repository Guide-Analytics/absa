0,R15JAJVO0L1X3O,True,Awesome light,"I love everything about this light except the price, and battery price.

I already owned a nitecore p12 and love it, but being a lumen freak, I had to get this more powerful version.
I'm so glad I did.
Cons:
No clip
No sheath

However,
It happens the clip and sheath from my P12 absolutely perfectly fit this light.
This light is nearly the same dimensions as the p12, except for the end cap (different configuration).
So I swapped them out.
Note: the anti roll washer which can be used on the p12 does NOT fit this light.

I am not hung up with needing a tail switch as vintage flash lights I grew up with never had them,
However the switch on this light is nearly flush to the case and so small finding it needs some focus sometimes depending on how you happen to pick it up.
I super glued the clip in place so it doesn't rotate so I can use it as a switch index.
Problem solved.
Nearly twice the lumens makes the small adjustment worth the trouble.

For me, a super purchase.

Update:
After having this light and operating it and the new model battery for a few days, I have to report I'm dissatisfied with my purchase and took off two stars due to the complicated and poor performance of the light switch.
It just does not work well.
I have to keep unscrewing and rescrewing the butt cap to reset the circuit to get it to function. I do this multiple times and eventually I get it to work as designed but definitely NOT on the first try maybe on the fifth.
For a professional,
This is unacceptable.
However it does produce light. I doubt it is 1800 lumens however.
My suggestion to the mfg is go back and redesign the switch making it simple and reliable.
We don't need all the strobe, beacon etc stuff. We just need it to work right, every time.

The p12 is a great reliable light and nearly as bright.
Wait for the next version before you buy this.

Update 2:
Figured out the trick to working this light, patience..
After light circuit initialzes, it will blink giving battery volts. Count to 4.
Turn on light, cycle through brightness, count to 4.
THEN you can turn off/on as desired waiting 4 count between each.
Otherwise it gets confused trying to enter turbo mode.
Again, I don't like this design.
But it does work.

Update 3:
Flashlight has stopped working.
Less than one week.

Very dissatisfied.
Don't buy this.",the united states,"January 12, 2018",Jim,1.0,0,2020-11-12 14:25:55.383996,2020-11-12 14:25:55.658300,"Nitecore EC23 1800 Lumens High Performance LED Flashlight, 1x High Capacity 3500mAh Rechargeable Battery and Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer",4.3,80.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07581N286,"{'parcel dimensions': '24.64 x 16.26 x 4.57 cm; 227 Grams', 'batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required.

1,R1MCJ9EHELRBQX,True,and has a great battery. I REALLY liked it,"This flashlight is very powerful and dangerous. I used it only for three nights, and put it away. I don’t use it any more. The main On/Off switch is on the side, it should be moved to the tail cap.
The flashlight comes on by itself while it is in the Nitecore NCP30 holster, because of the On/Off switch location. The bottom of my NCP30 holster melted from the heat of the LED, while I was carrying the flashlight on my belt. I switched holsters, and the result was the same.
I would give it 5 stars immediately if they move the On/Off switch to the tail cap, and leave the adjustment switch on the side. It is very bright, compact size, and has a great battery.

2,R36RYURMALMTM6,True,Very very good!,"My EDC. VERY bright and durable flashlight good for casual or tactical use (I just wish it had a button switch on the base for pistol/flashlight use). I also miss the micro USB charge port my other nitecore lights have, but the super high output battery holds a charge much longer than the usual 18650's.The throw is good for long distance spot and provides a good light ring for closer use and walking.

3,RKHENOF95L6SG,True,Super customer service and support.,"The Nitecore EC23 flashlight I received was defective and it would not function properly with the longer NL1835HP Nitecore battery. I contacted Lumen Tactical the seller and they sent me a replacement EC23 flashlight but it had a dark yellow spot in the center of the bright white beam. So I took the tail cap and center section of the replacement EC23 flashlight and used the good end with the LED and power switch from the 1st EC23 flashlight that did not have the dark yellow spot in the center of the bright white beam to finally end up with a functioning EC23 flashlight.
Now I have a working EC23 that is functioning properly. I hope this has taken care of the issue because this was my 1st Nitecore flashlight purchased. Lumen Tactical had made sure I have a working product and I thank them for solid customer service.
In the end all is well with my purchase and I do have the confidence to purchase from Lumen Tactical in the future and the service and customer support provided after my purchase was very good.

4,R1I49NMUPV356Y,True,I would not buy this flashlight again,"If you just need something small that is bright for casual use this might be okay. I bought this will the intention of using it while on duty and have so far been unimpressed. My first issue is the location/size of the button. The company call the location intuitive, however it is difficult to find quickly by feel at times, and nearly impossible to find by feel with gloves on. It is also easy to bump the button while placing it back in to a pouch and if it gets knocked to the lowest setting it is easy to not notice that it is on even in a dark area which can mean you have no battery the next time you go to reach for it. As another reviewer said the on/off should be on the tail cap. My next issue is the lack of a clip on the light which means the light can't be clipped to a vest and used in a hands ""free mode"" without first purchasing an accessory. Lastly is the battery which seems to be impossible to purchase without buying another flashlight. Using this flashlight with any other battery seems to greatly reduce its power, and I haven't been able to locate the same battery that isn't sold as a part of another Nightcore flashlight.

All and all I wouldn't purchase this light again and it will most likely end up forgotten in the bottom of my patrol bag as soon as my new one shows up.",the united states,"June 28, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,0,2020-11-12 14:25:56.493695,2020-11-12 14:25:56.837877,"Nitecore EC23 1800 Lumens High Performance LED Flashlight, 1x High Capacity 3500mAh Rechargeable Battery and Lumen Tactical Battery Organizer",4.3,80.00,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07581N286,,"#65,157 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

I owned what I thought was a very bright flashlight and this makes it look like a joke. My only complaint is that the brightness modes are a little awkward to access, since you need to memorize the correct amount of time to hold the button down for each mode (though it is cool that there is direct access to modes instead of having to cycle through all of them to get the brightest setting like my old one).

6,R32GA1I1W94NEP,True,"Get rechargeable li-on battery, do not use in turbo mode for long durations of time","This is an incredible work-tested flashlight. The major drawback of the package you receive is the lack of chargeable batteries, so be sure and buy a few rechargeable Li-on batteries of the appropriate size. For instance, my light came with a nearly discharged battery, which made me think the flashlight was faulty. Not so, once you put the freshly charged cell this flashlight starts to truly shine. The brightness levels vary from “just bright enough to see inside of a valve body” to “look at that bird half a mile away in the dark in the rain.” For a single LED light the performance is extreme. The flashlight does get hot at the brightest setting, but the brightest setting is unlikely to be used for long durations, as it is mainly a “dude look how bright this thing is lol” setting, and not useful in day to day applications. Overall, the fully metal body is right and resistant to impact, developing a nice “patina” of bangs and scratches while remaining fully functioning. It is relatively light, with most of the weight contained to the battery, and the weight is well distributed within the body.
