0,R3ROVOYW6RSFJT,True,Phenomenal back up flashlight/head lamp,"This is a great back up flashlight and a great headlamp alternative if you wear a hat. I've had this light for about two months now and I'm quite rough with, dropped it numerous times, and used it at night in pouring rain. the flashlight itself is tough the clip however is not. It began to loosen up and wouldn't hold onto my hat brim well and after a month and a half the clip broke into pieces. But I was able to improve on the light and make it better I simply glued a neodium magnet to it and it holds better to my hat brim than the clip ever could, only concern is it now lacks the waterproof capabilities than the clip provided, buts thats nothing a little tape can't fix.

1,R2A319NCGIJ6PY,True,light is great. but the clip is bad.,"This thing is great. More light than my MiniMaglite 272 but in a flood light instead of a beam. Works great as a cap light. The clip holds well to my cap brim. The clip is versatile, it can be installed in 4 positions, one of the positions is to cover the buttons so I can stick it in my pocket and not worry about it coming on accidentally. I don't have much use for the 1 lumen low setting but medium is good for not tripping over stuff in the dark. High is good for flooding everything in front of you for 30 feet or so. And turbo is very impressive for short term very bright light. If you leave turbo on constant for long periods the whole thing starts heating up, but that is to be expected at that level of light from such a small device. It's going to be my new 'get to the deer stand before daylight tool'

update oct 4 2017: The light is great, plastic clip is not so great. It has started being loose and sliding off. I wish it was made of metal so I could just bend it back in shape and tighten it back up. As it is right now i would never use it as a pocket clip or belt clip, too much chance of it falling off and getting lost. down to 4 stars because of the clip

update oct 7 2017: one side of the clip broke off. now its only good for a lanyard light or keychain. the clip really needs to be made of spring metal! down to 3 stars

update aug 2 2018: I own 3 of these now and 2 of them the clip has broken and are no longer usable as a hat brim light. the light is still great but not usable for what i bought it for.",the united states,"September 14, 2017",Sluggo,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:52:23.786403,2020-11-12 14:52:24.059408,"Nitecore TIP 360 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac USB Charging Cable (Black, More Colors in Options)",4.6,81.24,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06XXLK75C,,"#359,495 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2,RROK3AOS8I6KM,True,Loved it... Lost it... But we had issues together.,"So Full Disclosure: I lost mine. The Keyring Attachment failed & RIP TIP. It’s my fault though. I was tough on it - so I’ll be honest about that too. Regardless: It developed some problems & ultimately seemed as if it would degrade further over time.

What Went Sideways:

The internal portion of the USB charge port was getting very loose. Any minute jiggle on the cord would cause it to stop charging. The Clip/Button Cover was just fodder for loss. It lacked definitive retention to the light. It would flick off under moderate or above pressure. It Needs Tethering. The Keyring Mount is off somehow. Mainly tolerances between the bar and the flashlight are a bit too close. So larger/thicker split key rings fit awkwardly. Even Paracord is a bit tight. I never felt it was securely moored. Ultimately this is how it was lost: via Broken Keyring Mount...

What Was Cool:

It was bright when it needed to be. The button configuration was convenient. The turbo mode is a neat feature. The Outer Housing was Built like a Tank. It was a good size. It was ergonomic. It was weather durable: used mainly in: Rain/Snow/Highly Dusty Conditions. Held a charge for a sufficient amount of time.

Ultimately I’d have to say It didn’t hold up to Advanced Rigor. It might be sustainable for normal/lighter use. Just be kind to the USB charge port & keep an eye on the Button Cap/Clip. Lastly be mindful of how you connect it to Your Keys or related attachments.",the united states,"May 6, 2019",S Davison,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:52:24.070419,2020-11-12 14:52:24.301847,"Nitecore TIP 360 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac USB Charging Cable (Black, More Colors in Options)",4.6,81.24,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06XXLK75C,,"#359,495 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

3,R3QQZHV7L49F4P,True,"Best Everday Carry Keychain, Pocket Flashlight Ever!","This has got to be one of if not the best EDC pocket or Keychain flashlight ever made. I have spent probably 6 hours researching every EDC keychain, pocket flashlight on the market. I looked at Fenix, Thrunite, Surefire, MecArmy, Streamlight, Jetbeam, Klarus, Torchlab, Eagletac, and last but certainly not last Nitecore. Sure you can spend $100, $200, even $300 for a comparable if not better small EDC flashlight but dollar for dollar the size, performance, and cost of the nitecore tip is hard to beat.

When I first got the light I was very concerned that the 360 lumens would in fact be nowhere near as bright as advertised. After playing with it I thought I might be right. It was bright but after comparing it to a 100 lumen streamlight it seemed only a little brighter.

However after reading the manual I found there is a turbo mode that is activated by pressing and holding the mode button. It was more than twice as bright as the high mode so I do believe it is very close to 360 lumens.

The modes in lumens are: 360 turbo, 150 high, 35 mid, 1 low. The runtime is 30 min turbo, 1 hr 35 min high, 6 hr 30 min mid, 46 hr low. The runtime for each mode is very good for such a small, bright Keychain sized light. The beam distance according to the manual is 74 meters. The beam is more of a flood with a large Hotspot in the center.

The nitecore tip is much smaller than the picture leads it to be. It is small enough to fit on a Keychain but isn't nearly as small as those old button cell photon Keychain lights. It feels solid and well built and the buttons have an excellent audible click to them and work well. I like the two button system. It works well and provides easy ways to cycle through the modes and features.

The light is easy to charge using the provided mini USB cord or you can use your cell phone charger so you don't have to worry about keeping up with a special charger or cord just to charge the light. It charges fast. From a complete drain to fully charged the manual says it takes about 2 hrs. There is a small light under the buttons that will light up red when charging and will turn green when fully charged.

Every problem with the previous 2016 tip has been fixed with this version. They have added a clip that if turned around can protect the buttons from being pressed. If you don't want to use the clip to cover the buttons the light has a feature that will turn off the light after 30 sec. This can be turned off but I don't mind it so far.

All in all I think anyone in the market for a small Keychain sized EDC flashlight will be very happy with this light. It's small, bright, affordable, and easy to use. Everything a good everyday carry light should be. You will be hard pressed to find a brighter, smaller light on the market. Even the much heavier and larger Surefire titan plus that's 3x more expensive ($90) is only 300 lumens. 360 lumens in this size is almost unheard-of.",the united states,"April 26, 2017",Terry,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:52:24.309418,2020-11-12 14:52:24.585973,"Nitecore TIP 360 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac USB Charging Cable (Black, More Colors in Options)",4.6,81.24,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06XXLK75C,,"#359,495 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

4,R32THD4B6B2IZ0,True,No downside to this purchase.,"In all honesty I am a HUGE flashlight kind of guy and was pretty sceptical about how bright this keychain light could be. I should have known better than to doubt Nitecore's performance because this keychain light has gone above and beyond the call of duty. I have had and been using this light constantly for the past three weeks and havn't had to charge it yet! It has four different modes: Low, Medium, High and ""Turbo"".

5,RLUFANJZFPPA2,True,Holy Smokes!,"I used to buy Streamlight Nano lights  Streamlight 73001 Nano Light Miniature Keychain LED Flashlight, Black  for my keychain every several months because it costs the same to buy an entire new Nano light as to buy replacement button batteries for it. Then I noticed that newer keychain lights were available that had USB rechargeable batteries. I did some research and found that people were liking these Nitecore Tips. They are a little expensive, but I believe in spending a little extra to get something well made that lasts.

And holy smokes, what a revelation! This thing is awesome! The amount of light it can throw is astonishing, I love the modes, and the fact that I can easily recharge it. The construction seems very rugged. I got the blue anodized version. It's beautiful, and no doubt it will eventually get all scratched up by my keys, but that sort of thing doesn't bug me. If it bugs you, maybe get a silver one. The size is manageable; it's bigger than the Nano light but the extra lumens, the modes, the USB charging, and the more elegant design make it worth it. Also, the Nano light turns on by twisting the head. If it comes all the way unscrewed, it falls apart. The Tip has very satisfying clicky switches instead. This is a much better way to switch a flashlight on and off.

Anyway, I'm so impressed with this little thing that I've started buying them as gifts for my friends and colleagues.

6,R2D7ELA6L96SPX,True,Typical Nitecore Failure,"I purchased this light in March and it's seen very light duty but now it's July and the light is failing. When I go to turn it off, it flickers and stays on in low mode for sometimes an hour or more. I own many flashlights 4 of them are Nitecore and now two of them have failed.

I reached out to Nitecore customer service via email and was told I could return the light to China. A.) I don't want to pay shipping to China. B.) I don't want to be without a carry flashlight for the time it would take to get it back.

I'm really disappointed with their response and this will be the last Nitecore that I purchase after seeing the trend of failure with their products.

7,R8EKMSR58HUYJ,True,"More perfomace than my tactical lights, and it is always with me, charged and ready!","I have used about 7 different keychain flashlights and they have performed as advertised with the expected limitations (minimal lumens for maximum battery life). I had always used them as little as possible because I knew I wouldn't mess with changing batteries when needed. I just ordered a new and different light when the time came. The last was the Nitecore Tube and I was glad to be able to recharge via USB. But apparently I turned it on in my pocket one too many times and I did not catch it. It's dead now and won't accept a charge. In the process of ordering another Tube, I came across the Nitecore TIP 2017 SS. PERFECT. It is a bit more than what you would expect to pay for a Keychain light but it is way way way more than what you have ever expected in performance from a key chain light. It is exactly as advertised.

8,R3OMLMBLKXE6OO,True,Always ready to light your way,"This is the second and third Nitecore Tip keychain led flashlight that I own. My first was purchased about 2 years ago not long after they were introduced.
The outer shell is made from aluminum and is durable but, is not as robust as a cylindrical aluminum flashlight.
With light usage on low beam I can get months on a charge. The battery will charge within 2 hrs and has a mode to check battery charge level. It also has 4 levels of brightness with a fairly wide beam pattern.
The only issues that I’ve experienced with my Tip is on occasion the battery level red led will flash on a slow one flash per 5 second + - intervals for no reason. If I remember correctly the gang at Nitecore recommended plugging the light in for charging and it resets the the light to stop flashing.
The other issue was with the silicone rubber switch covers partially coming out of the housing when removing flashlight from my front pocket. It was easy to reinstall the cover using a thin rounded edge to push the cover back into the housing. Now I make sure I only insert a key in my pocket and use the flashlight to pull the keys from my pocket. The charging cord that is provided by this reseller isn’t from Nitecore and is made from what seems like thicker wire insulation as well as thicker plastic covered USB connectors. This thicker insulation make the cable somewhat less pliable but, isn’t an issue for me.
I usually buy Surefire products but, I didn’t like the plastic housing on their keychain flashlight that kinda looks like the Tip and I didn’t like the price on the Titan model.

EDIT: So I've had this light for over a year now and I still love it. I lost it outside for over a week and ended up finding it in my driveway, covered in snow and water. It was 32-40 degrees and snowing heavily in Michigan. When I found the light, it had water in the lens. I took it apart and there was zero moisture inside the light and near the circuit board.

10,R370NR0TFJKI4B,True,A Lot of Light From a Very Small Package,"Update: So I've had this light for 6 months now and it's just as amazing as the day I got it. It lives on my nightstand and I use it every night to take the dogs out in the backyard or just around the house when I don't want to turn on lights. I'll also toss it in my pocket if I'm heading out after dark. I charge it maybe once a month, just to keep it topped off, but it could probably go a couple months with light use without having to be charged.
__________________________________________________________________________________

So far, I really like this little light. The features are on point. It gets pretty hot when used in turbo mode for more than a couple minutes. Not too hot to touch, but it's worth noting. FYI, turbo mode is ridiculously bright. It's pretty amazing how much light this tiny little thing can put out. That said, this light is tiny and very lightweight, so if you like the feeling of a good, solid flashlight in your hand, you may think it's weird.

11,R3U73G4ZJRPYFU,True,... product and found it to be very durable and useful. The micro USB charger is a great asset,"I owned last years design and found this flashlight it to be very useful. The micro USB charger is a great asset as the device can be charged from a wall, computer, or car charging outlet. The metal case provides great durability. The only issue I had was that the light would accidently get turned on while in my pocket. This drained the battery and would cause some awkward situations as people questioned me regarding the light.

The newer design provides a pocket clip that is supposed to eliminate this mishap. I havent' tried it out, but am inclined to think it will be a small change that offers great benefit.

15,RMTAX6NR3TFQT,True,This light is fantastic. The controls work great,"This light is fantastic. The controls work great. Battery life in heavy use is exceptional. I use it at work regularly 30-45 per job. Sometimes I only do 1 job per day, but usually it's 3-4. I went over 3 weeks before I charged it and the power indicator was still giving me 2 flashes.

16,R3UAQLN4GTWKQ1,True,1-star reviewers are idiots,"This was more than I'd planned to spend on a new EDC flashlight, but I'm glad I did. It's very bright, has great battery life, and is crazy lightweight.

One of the things this light has that I don't see in others is the variety of modes you can access. On/off and brightness settings, of course, but also jump-to ultra bright and dim modes with or without push-to-hold.

It also has has a pocket activation protection setting, which is where all those idiotic 1-start reviews come from. It's supposed to turn off after 30 seconds, you friggin' rubes; it says so right in the manual and on the quick start sheet. Just hit either button again to keep it on, or you can ""fix"" this entirely by switching off the pocket protection.

17,R2G2RKOL4PGJOE,True,Very well worth it.,"I've had this for approximately 4 months now, and have had a chance to take a camping trip since receiving this flashlight.
My first impressions:
* Incredibly bright
* came fully charged, which I was not expecting.
I haven't had to recharge it yet, which really impressed me since I've actually used it (as opposed to the 30 minutes or so of playing around with it that I did while showing it off). It's very bright, and I'm very satisfied.
In short, this light has performed every time I've relied on it, and that's about as much as you can ask of any flashlight. The thinner profile makes it protrude a lot less from my pocket, which is a big plus, and the provided clip/dust cover/button protector is a great design. While I don't use the clip functionality often, it's used constantly for moisture protection/dust cover when its in my pocket daily. When I tested it, the clip worked just as I expected, which is to say very well. Overall I'd say I'm a big fan of the design, and as evident to me through the battery life and brightness, the execution as well. I'd recommend this to friends.",the united states,"August 13, 2018",Bennett Jenkins,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:52:33.921233,2020-11-12 14:52:34.149991,"Nitecore TIP 360 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac USB Charging Cable (Black, More Colors in Options)",4.6,81.24,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06XXLK75C,,"#359,495 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

Battery life is excellent, I recently used it heavily on a 2-night campout (at least several hours constant use at mid-level brightness) and still haven't charged it yet 3 days later with light use.

Comes with a short chain and self-locking hook for easy removal from your keychain.

25,R37Q9ZVZR42UPI,True,"Outstanding performance as a flashlight, but I knocked off points for the paint job (see photo)","This flashlight deserves a full review with video and everything, but for now I will say that it is a perfect addition to your EDC. Takes up about as much space as a BIC lighter, puts out an insane amount of light (I don't know the specs off the top of my head but I'm sure it's on the product page; I will say it is enough to blind someone, so be careful and don't point it at anyone).

Very simple to use. I lost the instructions a while ago but the functionality is easy to remember. Hold both buttons to toggle auto-off, hold down the front for turbo, and click to cycle. I use this daily as it is easier to use and hold than my phone, and puts out both more light and a more controllable light. Low is enough to read something in a dark room (as a bartender, I'll often use this to help a customer who needs to sign their check), and as I mentioned before, the high and turbo will blind someone. It will light up a pitch black driveway; I've used this to check outside my window at night. Bear in mind there is obviously no throw on this.

Overall, I can't stop singing praises of this thing's performance. According to Amazon, I've had this for a year (as of this review) and it has not failed. Battery life is great too, although I don't keep this on for hours at a time (the most was about 45 minutes).

The big negative that cost this product 2 stars: the paint job. I paid extra for the stainless steel ""tropical"" color, and within a few months it started flaking off. FLAKING. The paint job is similar to what you will find on die cast hot wheel cars (I believe it's acrylic?), so if you've ever seen a toy car flaking paint, that's basically what happened within a month of this purchase. I didn't expose it to any harsh chemicals, it was either in my pocket or in my hand. Nitecore, what happened? It broke my heart to take off two stars but come on, a vinyl skin would have probably lasted longer than whatever paint you used that chipped off and scratched my hands.

Terrible paint job aside, I would still recommend this to anyone who needs to carry a good light and doesn't want a full tube taking up space in their pocket. In fact, I recommend this to new employees at my bar daily, as we often need to perform maintenance in dark areas.

P.S.: use the auto-off if you leave this in your pocket, the body of this thing will get very hot in a concentrated area (not the bulb, but the LED electronic parts inside) and could burn you through your pocket.",the united states,"October 8, 2018",The Recommenderer Defenderer,3.0,0,2020-11-12 14:52:39.692170,2020-11-12 14:52:39.888745,"Nitecore TIP 360 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac USB Charging Cable (Black, More Colors in Options)",4.6,81.24,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06XXLK75C,,"#359,495 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

297,R3EGGIJA1BNNSA,True,Worth every penny.,"I have had this light for a few months now. It is amazing. I have had to use it a few times looking for various things while I have been away from home and it has worked great. It produces a lot of light in the middle and high setting. The Turbo setting is really overkill. Also, when not trying to shine too much light, or trying to preserve your night vision low works great. The fact that it has two operating modes constant and daily helps too. The daily mode turns the light on for only 30 seconds. This works great for a little while of looking for something, also a great protection in case it turns on accidentally in your pocket. Battery life is great and it is nice that it has a built in battery meter.

This light is an amazing addition to any keychain.

309,R173DCCPJO169,True,Great product!! Seller needs to work on handling and shipping (broken clip upon receipt.),This thing is insanely bright and after several months of carry seems very well made with great battery life. The different modes are very easy to cycle through and after reading the instructions its very simple to use. When I received mine the plastic clip was broken in the package and in spite of this I have not had many issues with it turning on during carry. I placed a carabiner on it and carry it with my keys on my belt loop of my pants.

324,R3A14FQREO2GMH,True,Nitecore nailed it but 😊,Nitecore hit a home run with the 2017 version of the TIP. The parasitic battery drone when in lockout mode is fixed and as a bonus they have included a clip that triples as a button cover to prevent pocket elimination and charge port protection to keep debris out of the micro USB connection point. I have not done a lumin test but I can say it is as bright as they claim. I like the fact that it flashes red when charging is needed. All in all they got a hat trick in my opinion,the united states,"May 11, 2017",Al Holsbo,5.0,0,2020-11-12 14:55:32.871230,2020-11-12 14:55:33.026404,"Nitecore TIP 360 Lumen USB Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight with LumenTac USB Charging Cable (Black, More Colors in Options)",4.6,81.24,,Tools & Home Improvement,B06XXLK75C,,"#359,495 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)
