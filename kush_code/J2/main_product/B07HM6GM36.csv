0,R1SSOCVPT9HCMA,True,My new EDC Flashlight,"I've never had a bad, or disappointing, product from Fenix. Every flashlight I buy from them exceeds my expectations. My old keychain flashlight was a Fenix AAA light, it.was great, still is, but I wanted more lumens. So bought the Fenix E16. Shorter than my AAA light, but a little fatter. I thought I would take the clip off, but after seeing it guards the on off switch, and how handy it is to clip it to a ball cap, I'll keep it on. Light is easy to use and bright. How bright 700 lumens with rechargeable, 300 lumens with backup CR123. How bright is 700 well focused lumens? Bright enough to illuminate anywhere around my yard like daylight. Back in the day I had 4 and 5 D-Cell Maglites ,the size of youth baseball bats, that weren't as bright, that couldn't throw a beam as far. All on a light little bigger than a CR 123 Battery, less than half the size of a roll of pennies. Just incredible the power of this little light.",the united states,"October 8, 2018",B. J.

1,R4MGS7AP13889,True,"Nice light,Bright, Nice size, but on-off-lock switch method is too wonky. Get a different model.","Fenix E16. I got this to replace my lost Fenix E15. Big mistake. While I LOVE the four brightness levels, The switch mechanism is a terrible design. Before I detail the switch operation, I'll tell you that even in spite of the TWO ""lock"" features, this light STILL turns on when in my front pocket. The switch is almost flush with the body of the light, making it difficult to find in the dark. It operates with a push button on the front side of the light. One press turns it on to the #2 setting (regardless of where you left it when shutting it off). One press and hold (1 second) turns it off. One press and hold for more than 1 second turns on STROBE (flashing). When on, one quick press moves to the next brightness level.

When on, two quick presses (within one second) puts it in ""lock"" mode"". If you press the button to turn it on when in lock mode, it just flashes twice to let you know it's ""locked"". To UNLOCK it, you press the button twice within 1 second and it turns on to level #2. It has a FURTHER physical lock, by sliding the ""hat clip"" over the top of the switch button. Even in this mode, my light has turned on in my pocket by leaning against a workbench or a car I am working on. It's not until I feel the heat from the light that I realize this has happened. Yes the light gets quite hot. Especially if it finds its way to 700 lumen mode. Further, if it's been on for a long time (in my pocket) the battery is somewhat low. The 700 lumen mode will not work when the battery gets to a certain level of discharge. If not inadvertently turned on as above, the battery lasts me about 3-4 weeks (intermittent use) before I need to charge it. I got two batteries with this and I rotate them in service. In the dark, it is difficult to find the switch and turn the light on (when you most need it).

I would not purchase this light again based on the clumsiness of the switch and ease of inadvertently turning it on., and in fact, I am considering selling it and getting a different model.",the united states,"November 7, 2019",The Irritator,3.0,0,2020-11-12 11:40:56.076960,2020-11-12 11:40:56.210943,Fenix E16 700 Lumen High Performance Keychain Flashlight with 2 USB Rechargeable Batteries and LumenTac Charging Cable,4.4,105.95,,Tools & Home Improvement,B07HM6GM36,,"#266,368 in Tools & Home Improvement (See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement)

2,RN4E3216K7UBY,True,Quality light... EDC for 6 months now. Picture current.,"This is a FANTASTIC flashlight. My ONLY gripe is if you don't lock it out (double tap the switch) before putting into your pocket you will feel you leg getting really hot at random times while this thing is blasting your pocket. The clip is also designed to block out the switch but getting into the habit of locking it with the switch is an easier habit for me to follow through with then that solution.

I did think this package was worth the purchase because I ALWAYS like to have a battery ready.... and can take an extra battery with me when needed (extra long hikes, camping, etc).

Also I drop in the pocket carry with my keys. Anodizing and lens are both holding up very nicely.

4,R1D7SRCUIJKKO7,True,Gets way to hot,"Very small flashlight and works well but turns on too easily in your pocket even if you double tap the safety feature.
